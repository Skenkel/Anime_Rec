       "'ent10                              Trigun is another one of my \"must see in your anime career\" shows. The easiest way to explain why I believe this can be summed up by one name: Vash. Vash the Stampede is arguably one of the coolest, toughest, and funniest characters ever created. He\\'s everyone\\'s favorite superhero (even though he demolishes everything he gets close to). Vash brings forth something that I think everyone has a little in themselves, compassion. If Vash had a middle name, it would be Compassion. As if Vash wasn\\'t enough for this show, they thought it might be a good idea to throw in a fantastic music score too.                  Tsuneo Imahori really hit the nail on the head with his work here. Great opening, great ending, and great background music throughout the show. I like some tracks so much that I often listen to them while exercising. Wolfwood, Meril, and Milly are great supporting characters. The constant bickering between them will trigger plenty of laughter. Not a ton of detail goes into their pasts, but enough is presented to satisfy the viewer. Animation is from the late 90\\'s, so it\\'s nothing crazy. It\\'s great for the time period though. Overall, one of my favorite anime shows. Worth a watch no matter what type of series interests you.                                      (This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)[Synopsis]: Vash the Stampede (Onosaka, Masaya) is a legendary gunslinger with a $60,000,000,000 bounty on his head who has attained the additional title of the ‘humanoid typhoon’ due to the way he leaves a path of destruction in his wake wherever he travels. Because of this rampant devastation, the Bernardelli Insurance Society tasks Meryl Stryfe (Tsuru, Hiromi)  and Milly Thompson (Yukino, Satsuki) to find Vash in order to evaluate insurance claims and attempt to minimize the damage. The story follows these characters across a desert wasteland as it quickly becomes apparent that Vash is more than                  a simple outlaw.[Characters]:Vash the Stampede, while an absolute ace in every category when concerning marksmanship, is also quite a carefree and kindhearted character. From the get-go it is revealed that the destruction that is attributed to him is actually the fault of the countless bounty hunters chasing after the reward for his head. With this in mind, he is perfectly capable of dealing out major damage with his signature revolver however perhaps his biggest character trait is that he always avoids killing his enemies – opting to disarm or at worst cripple them instead. This mindset, while at first a character quirk, becomes very central to the shows primary story after a turn in what could be described as the conflict of naivety. Vash occupies an odd dichotomy of personalities where he can be both silly and comical but gravely serious the next second. Vash’s past and the reasons for his preservation of life are explored fairly extensively and as the story progresses.Joining Vash on his journeys in the anime are the two insurance girls Meryl and Milly. While Meryl at first doesn’t believe Vash to be the legitimate ‘Vash the Stampede’ she eventually is convinced wheres Milly is much more certain after their first meeting. The two girls serve primarily as comedic characters throughout the show and their exaggerated reactions (mostly Meryl) are the source of a good deal of the shows comedy along with Vash’s antics. They are fairly flat characters and while they have emotions and serious scenes they feel fairly stunted on the development front. As the show grows more serious in the later episodes and the silliness of things is slightly phased out, they continue to tag along but seem to lack purpose.Lastly, Vash and company encounter a priest by the name of Nicholas D. Wolfwood (Hayami, Show) on their travels who at first fades in and out of the story intermittently but later becomes a more primary character. I would say that Wolfwood’s appearance is a marked improvement to the show as he is more complex and action-oriented than Meryl or Milly. He shares some qualities with Vash, comedic and otherwise, but is overall of the more serious characters in the cast.[Art/Animation]:As Trigun hails from the late 90’s period of anime it’s art and animation leave a decent amount to be desired in comparison to more modern shows. This aside, the character designs, primarily of Vash and his enemies, are very exaggerated however they don’t feel out of place in the world. The animation itself varies from episode to episode and naturally the more important action scenes are shown a little more love than others but overall Trigun is par for the course. The setting for almost all of the story is a desert wasteland and so there isn\\'t too much exciting to work with in that regard.One of my major issues with the show actually concerns its art and animation as I have a problem with how it presents both guns and bullets in the show. Because dancing around bullets is both a good source of comedy and also a clear way to show somebody’s speed of movement in an action scene – a good deal of bullets end up missing… a lot of them. This is highly apparent in that Vash goes more or less unscathed for a good portion of the early episodes – both a sign of his skill but hardly an episode goes by in Trigun where Vash doesn\\'t dart around screaming comically as a whole troop of enemies looses fire at him. So the problem arises in the over-prevalence of guns and the countless number of scenes where bullets seemingly accomplish nothing. When the show relies greatly on the threat of a gun in someones face (which happens multiple times episodically) it somewhat damages the tension and gravity of things when we are conditioned to think that the guns and bullets ultimately don’t mean much.[Story]:The show starts out feeling fairly episodic in nature – Vash travels to a city, he is pursued by bounty hunters or encounters a problem already in the city, action and comedy ensue and he moves on. This formula is used for the first 10 or so episodes and so Trigun can feel a bit slow to get into at first. The show picks up pace more than you would initially think it would and it also gets reasonably dark in comparison to its early far more comedic episodes.At the end of the day, Trigun is less concerned with with actual progression of a plot and more with the moral dilemmas associated with Vash’s lifestyle. Why does Vash cherish life so – and to what lengths will he go to uphold his near-pacifist ideals? The show attempts to drum up a discussion of morals by presenting us with a heroic figure who will stop at nothing to protect and help those in need but who will not take the life of his enemy. This very quickly becomes problematic for Vash and only becomes more so as the show continues – eventually becoming the main focus of the show within the ‘primary plot’. Trigun claims to harbor a moral message but in my opinion its a bit lost and unfounded amongst the action and comedy of the show – it pays close attention to Vash’s own morality but fails to bring up points for one cause or another with any real conviction; it is a little flaky in this regard.[Music]:The music of the show fits the setting well enough but isn\\'t anything I would go listen to again after the show ended. As the setting of the show features primarily sand and frontier towns the music is evocative of a wild west environment but there is some sci-fi influence as well.[Final Thoughts and Rating]: I think that ones enjoyment of the show will rely heavily on whether or not one thinks that the show explored Vash’s moral dilemma adequately or not. The show has decent comedy in the beginning and reasonably interesting plot developments later in the show however because the show’s main focus becomes a moral one I think it should be held to that standard first and foremost. I would say without that moral intrigue, the show’s comedy and action would rarely outstrip anything else in those respective genres and so additionally so, Trigun relies importantly on its messages.Rating: 5I will preface that my rating of this show is bias in that I am no great lover of the Sci-Fi western setting and that a more avid fan of that genre would be quick to give it a 6 or even as high as an 8 if they could overlook some of my more nit-picky qualms listed. The show falls short for me because as I have stated above, because it does not do anything exceptionally well and because its animation (by nature of its time period) is not actively beneficial to it, it appears overly reliant on what I would consider an ill-conceived or half-baked moral question.[Recommendations]:I think that anyone that jumps at the premise of a Sci-Fi western should certainly investigate this show as its setting and characters support the genre well. I would also recommend this show to anyone wanting to explore the more ‘classic’ anime as Trigun is very much one of the more storied shows in medium and is the point of many a conversation. To action fans looking for good gun-slinging fight scenes I would recommend this however admit that other shows probably hold greater potential in this aspect. Lastly, to those interested in the shows comedy – it has decent gag comedy at the beginning but because the show eventually discards many of these gags in favor of a more serious tone I would recommend a different show unless your willing to stick around after the tonal shift.        t10                              26 episodes of a revolutionary anime that mixed comedy and drama flawlessly. This anime found great popularity in the U.S. and for good reason. Like Wings of Honneamise, it very thoughtfully combined religious themes and pacifism in a morality tale. The first half of the series introduces the characters, and may turn some people off by its silliness, but it makes sense throughout the second half. If the entire thing was completely serious, Vash\\'s character development wouldn\\'t have the same effect.The music is very subtle and gets the job done. It\\'s not overly noticeable, and compliments the scenes quite well. I heard one of the                  members of the band Black Mages composed the music. The music is very recognizable and memorable for how simple it is.The characters are extremely well developed and human. Vash the stampede is one of the most multi-dimensional characters created in anime. You may be constantly asking yourself questions about him. So is he a womanizer or a gentleman? Is he a killer or a pacifist? A goofball or a serious, stern person? All of it is very well developed and lets you know that Vash doesn\\'t have just one side to him. His friend Wolfwood is also very multi-dimensional and developed.The animation and drawings in Trigun are not so great. They are in fact very mediocre, which is a shame. Many of the lines are drawn poorly, unevenly and the movement is often very choppy and of a low frame-rate (some of the episodes don\\'t suffer from this, however). The lower quality animation is probably a budget issue, so it\\'s a little easier to forgive. It must be extremely difficult to craft such a great series under so much pressure.However, it\\'s definitely one of the greatest moral dramatic comedies I\\'ve ever seen. The last few episodes left an impression on me; the show has a very clear and valuable message that has staying power. If you are up for a nice 26 episode series to laugh and cry with, give Trigun a whirl.        0                              Trigun is a classic Sci-fi, Action, Adventure, Comedy series with an amazing Western concept. This action-packed show is full of adrenaline fuelled gun battles and an awesome character to back.The story follows our protagonist Vash, who is known as a terrifying Gunman with a $60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The story is laid out as an episodic adventure, where each 1 or 2 episodes brings about a different story, involving certain trials and hardships the characters experience. The good thing about this series is that each adventure is nicely linked to the next, so there is a form of progression and development. But this all                  changes later on in the series, where there&rsquo;s a major plot-twist and it becomes clear that this is an adventure with a purpose.By this being a sort of episodic adventure series, there are a bunch of characters but very few recurring ones. At least the main character (Vash) makes up for all that. Vash is a very complicated protagonist and even in the very first episode you&rsquo;ll know that there&rsquo;s more than meets the eye. What&rsquo;s more is that both voice actors do an excellent job on him, bringing out plenty of comedy and intensity from his dialogue. The other characters do a fine job too but most of them don&rsquo;t do much to stick out.The quality of the animation in this series is amazing. Taking into consideration the year it was produced (1998); this is certainly one of the best looking, old, action anime of its time. Even though the character designs lack a bit of detail, the well-drawn destructible environments and fluid gun battles make up for it.The music goes for the whole Country theme which suits this Western anime perfectly. However the soundtrack overall is nothing spectacular, with only a few notably great tunes and the OP and ED themes are pretty tiresome to listen to after a while.Overall Trigun on the surface may seem like your typical bang! bang! shoot &lsquo;em up, but this actually has a very deep story that will make you feel differently about life. Even though there are a lot of characters throughout the series, there are quite a few memorable ones and plenty of memorable moments in the series. This anime did so well in both the comedy and drama areas, which makes this highly entertaining to watch.^_^                                      I personally like this anime, however due to some pacing issues & tone, this series is not for everyone. Trigun anime should be considered to the original Fullmetal Alchemist as it doesn\\'t follow it manga storyline & is more original content, however there are some strengths to this adaptation. Also, it\\'s main principle isn\\'t gunslinger fights but its true writing is based on morality.Taking place on Planet Gunsmoke where desert is found everywhere forcing people to live in this harsh climate. To make matters worse, people have developed this culture of the wild west leaving many outlaws running about. One of these men is Vash                  The Stampede whose head is worth $$60 Billion. The anime revolves around his quest to find his brother Knives, stop his villainy & bring peace to his homeland. Much of the anime is bit rough, to start off people should be aware of its comedic tone as Vash & various characters are very goofy which often clashes with the more serious subject matter of the show being pacifism & Christianity. The early episodes can be slow at times as the real story doesn\\'t kick until episode 12 but even then the story doesn\\'t go full throttle until ep 15 when The Gung Ho Guns finally move as a group; challenging Vash\\'s ideology.The theme of this story is its study in pacifism on a dangerous planet, where villains with various skills & super powers won\\'t budge easily to words of peace. This is one of the few western based animes that has an interesting tale but I can certainly people not being into the series due to several circumstances. Main problem with the anime is its pacing & enjoyment will heavily depend on the leading character Vash as he be found annoying to some. When the anime isn\\'t firing bullets it instead speaks of philosophy, however it isn\\'t till ep 17 we understand why Vash is pacifistic in the first place & comprehend his motivations to follow those principles which are heavily affected with his brother Knives,who again, has minimal appearances in the anime. Because of this lack of knowledge, can lead to some viewers not willing to sit through the entire series.Benefits in the anime include many as when compared to its manga, honestly has better writing & possibly even better conclusions to certain story arcs specifically death scenes. One example of the anime\\'s strengths is the character Wolfwood who shares more screentime with Vash while in its manga, their interactions or moral conflicts aren\\'t as strong compared to its anime. Much of the dialogue & writing placed into the anime is more \"to the point\" (in episodes 15-26) as the manga Trigun & Trigun Maximum tend to get a bit distracted at times.Overall, Trigun appeals to certain people but if it does suit your tastes then you may enjoy it either for its setting or its search for the morally correct answer. The anime tends to  give subtle messages to the conflict of the series. Most of the strengths of those messages is the opposing beliefs of Vash & Wolfwood as not many other pacifistic themed animes feature a duo such as this one. Multiple villains also challenge Vash\\'s beliefs in a more drastic level with casualties being build up with every encounter.It also holds two of the most interesting anime villains to date being Legato Bluesummers & Knives Millions. Trigun\\'s main focus isn\\'t action, but instead dives into a theme heavily resembling beliefs found in Christianity. Other similar series would be Get Backers, Naoki Urasawa\\'s Monster, Rurouni Kenshin & both series of Fullmetal Alchemist. The main difference that separates Trigun from these shows include the following; Vash\\'s decisions & villains affect the planet\\'s society, its western world with its own blend of sci-fi, & its references with religious elements mainly the siblings Vash & Knives & might have a better conclusion although it may come off as either subtle or ambiguous.                                      Trigun is a great anime, i remember i watched this on Cartoon Network but i didn\\'t watch it all, i think it was after Pokemon and after that i was 90% of the time outside building the other part of my childhood playing with my friends, so i never had the chance to see it all until now.StoryAt first is really simple, it follows an episodic formula for 10 eps. and i thought it was fine, nothing special until half way through the anime where everything gets better and interesting with not just action and comedy but with drama, and it really is dramatic if                  you think how Vash\\'s ideals are flawed, it\\'s genuine and i think just like him but that can be seen as hypocrite because he chooses the life of bad guys which will eventually change life of innocents for worse and even their lives ending in death, even tho he knows he\\'s being chased, he decides to put people in danger by staying near them, he sure is the \\'\\'humanoid typhoon\\'\\'.He\\'s followed by two women from the insurance company to watch for his actions and see that he doesn\\'t destroy the cities (they fail most of the times) and to be annoying to him but they gain affection towards him, specially Meryl, she falls for him, she is always happy to see him and wants to be close to him. He meets a lot of people that will help him in his adventure, a rough destiny for him to accept but he finally does at the end, and the ending was unsatisfying, without a conclusion, i needed more. Oh there\\'s always a Black Cat in every episode easy to spot on. There\\'s lack of explanation to certain things that are really important, like what is Vash exactly, why this two babies had powers, how can they live more than 100 years (maybe forever untill they are killed) a lot more questions, because of that it was just good.Art & AnimationThe animation was very good considering it was from \\'98 and i liked it, there are animes from that period of time that didn\\'t have a good animation, so i was glad it wasn\\'t like that in this case.SoundThe VA was great, at first i didn\\'t like Vash\\'s voice because i have heard that voice on a lot of gay characters in previous animes, so it felt weird but i accepted his voice, and it was funny. The music was enjoyable and the OP was great the ED sometimes i felt it was not fitting because after every dramatic ending episodes was followed by that song, it killed the mood for me.CharacterA bunch of great characters, they are really good, even the annoying insurance company ladies becomes likeable.-Vash has a lot of development, he has a lot of backround and that\\'s great, the only thing that i was asking was, what he really was? i need to know; Vash at first seems coward, a fool who can be made fun of, but in later episodes you will think he\\'s badass and such a great person.-Wolfwood is the other badass, he needed more backround development tho, because only little is known about him, and one friend told me he was younger than how he looks, a lot younger, really young.-Meryl is the annoying of the two insurance bla bla. she is really annoying at first, she still is a little, but she understands later that she\\'s annoying to Vash and she knows nothing about him, only the rumors.-Milly is the funny pitch voiced big girl with the mentality of a kid but sometimes smart, she is kind and really funny and she falls for Wolfwood just like Wolfwood for her, and there\\'s a sad ep. involving not only both of them but others.A lot more of characters that are interesting an equally good, the bad guys you want Vash to kill the majority of them, but because of his ideals innocents don\\'t seem to be enjoying in the grave.EnjoymentI had a great enjoyment from the anime and i wanted to see more because of that meh conclusion, i really was entertained, it wasn\\'t perfect because the first half was nothing more than good, but is really enjoyable after all.        nt10                              OverviewTrigun is a 26 episode anime from 1998 and is one of the definitive examples of the \"Space Western\" sub-genre that gained popularity in Japan in the late 1990s and in the United States in the early 2000s with Joss Whedon\\'s Firefly. It takes place on a mostly desert planet called \"Gunsmoke\" where a colony ship crashed a little over a century before the story begins. The technology on this planet could only be described as Steam Punk to the extreme. If you haven\\'t heard of this slightly older series, why not give this review a read? I promise I won\\'t ramble THAT much!Trigun not                  only tells a fun and at times moving story, but brilliantly pays homage to the great Westerns of old. For example, in one of the first episodes there is a quite lengthy shot of an old creaking windmill. This is a direct reference to a famous scene from Sergio Leone\\'s Once Upon a Time in the West. In another episode the characters walk down the dusty street into a ghost town with scared civilians slamming their shudders to hide. This is yet another Sergio Leone reference. I could go on, but there are too many of these to list.Story 9/10Trigun starts out with 2 girls working for an insurance company attempting to find the world\\'s most dangerous and destructive man and kindly asking him to stop wrecking things. The man is called Vash the Stampede and has a 60 billion dollar bounty on his head!!! Considering the fact that Osama Bin Laden only had a 25 million dollar bounty, this tells you that Vash is a VERY wanted man. Trigun starts out with zany action of the shonen variety and later gets significantly darker and more serious, becoming more seinen if anything. The manga also made the transition from being published in a shonen magazine to a seinen demographic magazine, but the manga actually ran from 1996 to 2008. The anime did this heavy transition in just 26 episodes. After meeting the insurance girls and going on a few largely episodic adventures, Vash reveals his dark past and must confront his maniacal brother Knives and his frightening, nihilistic minion Legato Bluesummers. I won\\'t spoil anything, but know that this series will take you on quite a ride.Characters 10/10Trigun has very well fleshed out characters that truly make the viewers care about them and desire to know them better. The main character is Vash (French for cow) who despite being the world\\'s most wanted man has never actually killed anyone and is a devout pacifist. However, destruction and massive property damage seem to follow him where ever he goes. Vash prefers to run rather than fight and rarely ever uses his gun, unless he absolutely needs to. He also will at times spontaneously start babbling in French. Vash is easily the greatest French super hero in the history of comics. Vash\\'s humanistic ideology is the product of his being raised by an idealistic dreamer named Rem. Yes, that is the name of the brain waves that occur during dreaming, Trigun has many name puns. Vash\\'s brother Knives was also raised by Rem, but rejected her teachings and believes that humans are worthless vermin that destroy the environment of every planet they inhabit. Knives wishes to wipe out all humans in order to save the various animal and plant life of the desert planet Gunsmoke. We are also introduced to the badass Catholic priest Wolfwood and his giant gun shaped like a cross. Did I mention Trigun gets very silly at times? Wolfwood doesn\\'t follow any of the clergy rules and smokes, drinks, womanizes, and has little aversion to killing whenever threatened. However, he has his own strong sense of justice and is a loyal ally. There are plenty of other great characters, but this paragraph is getting lengthy already, so just watch the show if you want to learn more.Soundtrack 9/10Trigun has an excellent jazz soundtrack with plenty to offer for lovers of the Sax. Hell, there is even a villain that used a fucking saxophone as his primary weapon in a later episode. Trigun also has tracks that are heavily influenced by the Spaghetti Westerns that it so obviously loves and often emulates. The soundtrack will get your adrenaline flowing and make you in the mood to see a ridiculous gunfight.Art 8/10Trigun is very well drawn for a 1990s anime and has aged quite nicely. The stereotype for 1990s and especially 80s anime is that is terrible with its use of key frames, recycled animation, barely animated lip flaps, suffers from a very low frame per second rate, and is in general both lazily and cheaply animated. This was the time before Japan followed the Americans and exported all the animation to the Koreans, who work very hard for very cheap. Trigun is a shining example of 1990s anime art that shows that not all anime from that period was absurdly lethargic and shitty like Dragonball Z and Sailor Moon.Enjoyment 10/10Trigun is an absolute blast from the past and will leave you wanting 26 episodes more. The well written story, fun characters, fluid animation and epic gun fights, all come together to make this my favorite space western of all time. Yes, I actually like Trigun over Firefly. You can post your hate comments on my wall if you absolutely have to. I loved this series when I was 15, I love it at 26, and will love it until I am dead and rotting in the ground.Overall: 10/10Trigun is one of my favorite anime of all time! There are a couple series that barely edge out Trigun, but really not many out there are better than this. If you haven\\'t seen Trigun yet, I would highly recommend it. All episodes are free on youtube on Funimation\\'s page, so it won\\'t cost you anything. If you see a few episode and just absolutely hate it, you don\\'t have to watch the whole thing. However, it is a series that absolutely everyone should at least try.                                      On the technical side of things, Trigun is as dichotomous as Vash himself when it comes to animation. The rough and tumble design is the result of an attempt to imitate American superhero comics within the framework of standard anime style. Interesting, but maybe not so great in execution. Trigun has moments of visceral brilliance in its unique style but can also look like dust-covered Tomas vomit when the budget drops out and those exaggerated character models can stand up no better than Barbie in heels, making it a visual hit-and-miss. The soundtrack is one of the more underappreciated out there, consisting of a lot                  of guitar mixed with arbitrary banging and scraping on neither drums or washboards, but mysterious junk. This noise-music really brings the bleak world of Trigun to life, accenting every heartbeat and gunshot with a balance of intensity and silence. As for the voicing, veteran Satsuki Yukino does play a really awesome Milly, and for the most part the rest of the acting is good in Japanese, but oh gosh, Trigun is so rewarding in English! Where Vash’s seiyuu unfortunately overacts anytime things get too serious, Johnny Yong Bosch seems to understand the part better and can play up both the cartoony moments and the tragic ones while sounding very natural. Actually, natural’s a pretty good word for the entire dub. The cast may rant into goofsville frequently, but they always sound warmly human, and the western archetype snarls and slurs are entirely too much fun. I especially liked the voicing of Wolfwood, who has a thick Kansai accent in Japanese, traditionally dubbed as a thick Southern accent, but played by Jeff Nimoy as more like what it actually sounds like: gently lilting but with a lot of bark in the back of the throat. I’ll admit there are some awful extras floating around here and there, but overall the English Trigun seems to breathe much easier than the Japanese.I might as well state the obvious up front. Trigun has awesome gunfights. It is also enormously funny and wildly original. But the characters of Trigun are the heart and root of the series. Vash is hands-down one of the most memorable heroes ever created from his bizarre appearance to his enigmatic personality, equal parts deadly grizzly and teddy bear. But even he can’t carry the story alone. Wolfwood is arguably more popular even than Vash, and just as fascinating in both his reflection of Vash’s nature and his fervent opposition of his way of life. Not to mention the insurance girls whose profound effect on the boys is far too spoileriffic to go into here. These four, along with the many striking side characters and bookoodles of fearsome villains, carry the bulk of the insanity around them with incredible ease. What do I mean by insanity? I mean that this series is a deceptive little bugger, that’s what. It starts off with a deafening slingshot into wild comedy and over-the-top violence in a series of formulaic standalones that are so good, they probably could have carried 26 episodes all by themselves. There is a lot of heart in these comedy vignettes, but it’s still all brains-off popcorn viewing…or so we think. Viewers can’t rely on Trigun as a pick-me-up for very long, because halfway through the ride we find out that the peaceful outlaw’s past hasn’t made peace with him, and the systematic vengeance Legato and his hired guns exacts on Vash begins a long plunge into wickedly effective pathos, twisting into darker and crueler places until it climaxes in a scene so nerve-shattering you’ll find it difficult not to yell at your screen a little. And surprise, surprise, THAT’S not even the end. So, is this bolt from the blue rollercoaster a bad thing? It could have been. The spiral from comedy to drama has killed many series before and after it, but to come full circle here, Trigun is saved through the depth and humanity of its cast. Vash’s philosophy of nonviolence is charming at first and easy to rally behind, but once put in a harsher context, Vash has to wonder if it’s killing more people than it saves and struggles far more against himself than Legato, making this not only an emotional surprise, but a profoundly deep one as well, all thanks to the believability of the not-so-cartoony characters.That’s not to say the plot isn’t a force to be reckoned with, but tied to Vash as it is, it’s bound to be a juggernaut that’s just a little hard to follow. You will not hear a single line of blatant exposition in the whole story. In fact, while it’s widely known that Trigun is a space western, it’s never even made clear that we’re on a distant planet until episode 6, or how the earthlings ever got there until episode 17. This slow cultivation of the plot makes for greater realism, but it’s what I like to call manga-contingent. You don’t have to read the manga to understand the main story or all the important things. But Trigun is extremely subdued and tight-lip when it comes to the all the little unanswered questions like why Legato hates slave-traders most of all, what Gunsmoke’s Plants really are, and why Wolfwood is vaguely hinted to be…how old?! (See if you catch that little detail...) There are answers, but they’re buried in the manga. On top of that, Trigun is a PG anime adaptation of an R-rated manga, so while the manga makes it explicitly clear how Legato kills some individuals and how a mysterious figure named Knives can make entire populations disappear overnight, the anime will leave all the darkest details to your imagination. Some people love this, some people don’t, but you’ll be hard pressed not to find something to love about Trigun. It’s one of the great classics, it’s a lot of fun, it’s thought-provoking, and it’s the only gunsling-fest you’ll ever see where the man on the wanted poster shouts “LOVE AND PEACE!”All in all, Trigun has its fair share of scarring in scraggly animation and overly secretive storytelling, but few other series have such brazen hearts of gold. The story is powerful, the characters are incredibly complex, and when the darkness lifts, it’s always a rip-snortin’ good time.*THIS IS A PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT OF MY VIDEO REVIEW WHICH CAN BE SEEN HERE:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C16kNsDCjG8Thanks for reading!                                      I\\'m writing this out of my opinion, also I need to point out that I\\'m not going to directly tell spoilers, but I do tell kind of what happens without giving out any names.Everyone says that Trigun is a 20th century anime gem. While I didn\\'t enjoy it as much as other people do, I don\\'t hate it.I mostly want to talk about the plot because I think it was probably the biggest reason why I didn\\'t enjoy it as much as other people (or maybe it\\'s just because I watched it subbed cause I prefer dub). Anyway the backstory involving Vash is actually really                  good. I actually find it better than most backstories of other anime characters. Now I haven\\'t watched that much anime, but from what I\\'ve seen, usually the protagonist\\'s lover dies, his family dies, or someone close to him betrays him. Vash\\'s backstory sorta involves all three of those factors and that\\'s why I do like it cause it really does make you feel sympathetic for him. Now I did say I have a problem with the plot and it mostly has to do with all those filler events that occur. I just mostly find them kinda boring (except for the action) even though some people say that they\\'re also what makes the anime good. They were too short and didn\\'t really have a purpose. The second half of the anime was a lot better because it focuses more on Vash\\'s backstory. It has more action and less filler events, and lets not forget Nicholas D. Wolfwood.There were also too few characters in the anime. Now there are four main characters, Vash, Meryl, Milly, and Nicholas. I do like Vash and Nicholas like everyone else whose watched this, but Meryl\\'s just mehhh, and Milly is like bringing a titan into a western anime. I do realize there are a lot more characters than that, but they usually only appear in one of the filler events, or maybe they\\'re seen in a flashback, or they simply just die. Now I\\'m not saying there has to be a hoard of characters like Log Horizon, but I do wish they had more than just four that would stick around with the gang.I guess I\\'ll sum up the rest of the anime in this paragraph. The art style was good. The artists did their job well so yeah. I usually like the art styles of older anime like DBZ, Ranma 1/2, and Inuyasha, but the art styles of modern anime are good too. The voice acting was fine, but I did watch it in sub and I\\'m not the best judger of Japanese voice acting. The villains of this anime were mostly forgettable, but they were unique, I guess. I actually don\\'t remember.This wasn\\'t the only western anime I\\'ve watched, but no, the other one ain\\'t Cowboy Bebop. I\\'d prefer Gun X Sword, if you\\'ve ever heard of it, I like better cause there are more characters, there are less filler events and better villains, and the ending was a lot better in my opinion, plus there are gundams, kind of. So you should definitely watch Trigun, but in my opinion, it might be hard to continue if you start out. Remember this is just my opinion, I would probably recommend you just listen to the people who rated it a 9/10 or sometin, but you should still watch it. I will watch the movie and I am looking forward to it.                                      I saw the English-dubbed version of Trigun on Adult Swim in 2003, and I hated it.  I still hate it now, but my reasoning for it has changed after thinking about the anime much deeper than before in recent years.  Widely considered an all-time anime classic, I see it as not much (if any) better than the cookie-cutter low-brow swill like Naruto.STORYThe story for Trigun is that a mysterious gunman named Vash the Stampede roams a largely desolate planet called Gunsmoke and causes destruction everywhere he goes, even though he doesn\\'t intend to do so.  Vash has a gigantic bounty on his                  head and lots of bounty hunters, including a psychotic genocidal freak named Knives and his minions named the “Gun-ho Guns” are out to get him.TONAL AND STYLISTIC INCONSISTENCYI\\'ll be frank and say the tonal and stylistic inconsistencies are essentially the “death sentence” for Trigun, because it taints just about every aspect of this anime and makes it so painful to watch.  It\\'s like the writers of Trigun couldn\\'t decide between making a cartoonish and light-hearted shoot em\\' up anime or being a serious action anime with plenty of drama and elaboration of clashing philosophies, so they settled upon the worst option and chose both.  Now mixing comedy with drama isn\\'t a bad idea in and of itself when done properly.  The problem with the overwhelming majority of anime titles that have both elements is that the comedic elements usually share equal (if not greater) space with the dramatic elements, and the aesthetics of the comedy don\\'t match the overall aesthetics of the anime in question.PLOTTINGThe plotting in this anime is also victim of the tonal inconsistencies because the anime starts off on the light-hearted, cartoonish side but steadily progresses into something largely serious.  This doesn\\'t sit well with me because I want the tone of a series or movie to be largely consistent and if there is variation, the variation has to be moderate.CHARACTERSContrary to the gobs of gushing reviews, most of the characters aren\\'t works of art.  People everywhere have lauded how “complex” Vash the Stampede\\'s character is.  Yes, in a technical sense, his character is complex, but you have to remember that every quality has its good and bad sides.  Vash\\'s character is very inconsistent, because he\\'ll act like a loud circus clown then out of nowhere, he\\'ll turn into a whiny pacifist who eats doughnuts and constantly bleats “No one has the right to kill another,” and in some rare instances, he\\'ll turn into a tough-as-nails gunman who doesn\\'t kill the bad guy at the last minute because he just remembered it was “wrong.”  Vash\\'s character is comparable to a dish of cottage cheese, powdered milk, boiled tofu, chicken salad, sweet potatoes, cheap Mexican beer, and chopped liver; they\\'re both complex, but they\\'re certainly not good.  Some “contrasting” personalities can add depth to a character\\'s main personality, but those other personalities should be there only to complement the main one and be moderate in tone, NOT to share equal space or overpower the main one because it makes the character look very awkward in an unpleasant way.  An example of Vash\\'s inconsistent personality is in one episode where Vash is on a space station and one of the Gun-ho Guns is aboard as well, gunning down helpless people.  However, there\\'s plenty of scenes with Vash “navigating” through the space station by using his arm-mounted machine gun to shoot giant holes through the space station floors and while he falls, he screams and makes a big dumb face.  Now mixing that loud and dull visual comedy with helpless people being executed like that doesn\\'t sit well with me because it makes the comedic and somber tones feel cheap and undermined. Another is when a senile midget controlling a giant guy with projectile fists is destroying everything, Vash puts on his “serious” tone and stops the old guy and his living weapon, but after that\\'s done, he starts acting like a clown and starts yelling “The world is made of love and peace” with a bunch of kids.  Hand me a barf bag.  In previous years, I loathed Vash\\'s pacifist philosophy just because he refused to kill people, but that\\'s largely changed now.  Batman as portrayed in Batman:  The Animated Series refused to kill people, but was far more likeable because he didn\\'t act like an obnoxious goofball in one moment and turn into a dead serious crime fighter at the drop of a hat.  After some mental re-evaluation on certain plot points in Trigun, I was screaming to myself in one of Vash\\'s “killing people is wrong” speeches “ALRIGHT, WE GET IT!!  SHUT UP!!”  It doesn\\'t help that in the English dub, Vash is voiced by Johnny Yong Bosche, who has one of the most unpleasant and whiny voices I\\'ve ever heard in any medium.  Some characters like Wolfwood and Knives are actually pretty interesting because they largely maintain a consistent tone (and thankfully, they\\'re more on the serious side), but the consistent characters are unfortunately, less in abundance compared to the inconsistent ones.  Meryll Stryfe and Millie Thompson weren\\'t terribly impressive characters because they seemed like all too conventional cutouts of the “George and Lenny” dynamic in the John Steinbeck classic Of Mice and Men, other than the occasional moments of Meryll screaming her head off in a comedic style (these moments aren\\'t funny to begin with).THEMESThere\\'s some potentially good themes in Trigun about the clashing philosophies between Vash and Knives since the former doesn\\'t believe anyone should be killed, while the latter believes in something closer to eugenics as to where all the “weak and stupid” should be killed so the superior creatures can live in a “better world.”  I also like how in one flashback episode where Vash and Knives are kids, Vash sees a spider web with a moth being stuck on it and a spider getting ready to eat it, but Knives kills the spider.  Vash protests and says he should have saved the moth instead, but Knives\\'s justification is pretty interesting because it was pretty legitimate, which was “If I save the moth, the spider will starve.”  Sadly, these themes are undermined by the well-established tonal inconsistencies.APPEARANCEThe animation and artwork is actually pretty good, and it shows another quality product from Madhouse Studio (only speaking about production).  The animation is pretty smooth and the artwork is nicely detailed, though I\\'d say this is one of Madhouse\\'s lower-quality products (along with that abomination High School of the Dead).  However, more inconsistencies lay in here as well.  Vash makes really goofy exaggerated faces throughout the series (along with many other characters), such as when Vash defeats the main bad guy in the first episode, he makes a cat face when he says something like “Some toys are fun, but you can get hurt.”  Also, for an anime with villains that do pretty terrible things, some of the villains\\' appearances undermine the grim moments since they look like something ripped out of Power Rangers (yuck).SOUNDTRACKThe soundtrack is okay, I guess, nothing special.  I honestly don\\'t remember much of it other than some Western-sounding acoustic guitar riffs and some riffing more on the electric and funky side.  I wasn\\'t impressed the last time I heard Trigun\\'s music, but the music wasn\\'t anything offensive, so I guess that\\'s a plus.FINAL WORDTrigun is a classic case of “what could have been.”  Had this anime maintained a serious tone and focused on the clashing philosophies of Vash and Knives and didn\\'t waste time with gobs of redundant comedic filler, this could have been the “great” anime that legions of people are hailing it as.  If you like comedy mixed with serious tones, then you may like this.  However, if you\\'re like me and HATE mixing the two, skip Trigun since you won\\'t get anything out if it that you can get from numerous other titles that are much superior.  If you want some decent light-hearted/comedic anime, go get yourself some Devil Hunter Yohko and Excel Saga (at least they both maintain consistency).  I suggest you go watch Perfect Blue, Battle Angel, Neo-Tokyo, Shigurui:  Death Frenzy, and Ghost in the Shell for some quality “mature” anime.Now I want to see Batman and the Punisher taking turns whooping Vash\\'s pathetic ass and then have the Punisher blow his head off with a  Desert Eagle.        t10                              “It\\'s so big...Of course, that\\'s because it\\'s full of mercy!”“A man who takes a stand, though it scars him from head to toe, and that man is here”I first watched this anime on tv back when I was a kid that couldn\\'t comprehend much of Trigun\\'s philosophy, but still got the essentials of its message : \"It\\'s all about LOVE & PEACE!\" I recommend this anime for the newer anime fans, that only watched recent animes,  I believe that watching this anime will make you appreciate the anime industry more, and their development across the history.*It will be a rather long review, so beware*The                  story centers around the character of Vash the Stampede, nicknamed \"The Humanoid Typhoon\", a man with a $60,000,000,000 bounty on his head. The rumors are varied and never the same, some say he has a mohawk, others say he\\'s blonde and wears red clothes, but most stories agree that wherever he goes, disaster follows, leaving whole cities in ruin, but as if it were an act from God, there are no human casualities.We are introduced to the characters of Meryl Stryfe and her partener Milly Thompson, who are sent by an insurance company to investigate the cause of the destructions, Vash. They encounter in rather strange circumstances a young man who matches the physical description of  Vash the Stampede, but they soon dismiss that idea, since the young  man was too air-headed and gulliable to be the notorious infractor. However, when they are in a pinch, the man goes to their rescue, showing determination and fearlessness in the face of danger. Since their first encounter, the two insurance employees meet the mysterious young man on various occasions, and on many of these, the young man protects or tries to protect the defenseless, without killing anyone, but taking the violence on himself. Because of his pacifistic ways, Meryl tries to convince herself he is not Vash, despite all the proof that indicate otherwise, like his expert gunsmanship and his otherworldly ability to deflect attacks that are not humanly possible to deflect. However, when asked what is his name, he tries to avoid to answer, in the end the girls discover that he is indeed the real Vash the Stampede. From then on, Vash is under the insurance girls surveillance, travelling along with them. Being able to know the real nature of Vash, a pacifist at heart, the girls gradually forget the rumors that portray him as a heartless villain.The first part of the anime is episodic, and focuses on the pacifistic nature of Vash, showing how far he can go saving other people without killing the agressors. The latter half centers on the 100 years old conflict between Vash and his twin, Knives. Knives sends a criminal group called \"Gung-Ho-Guns\" in order to assasinate Vash (or to make him stronger). Knives\\' right hand is Legato, he serves the purpose of being the master-mind of many schemes to make Vash suffer.  In comparison to the first part that is light-hearted and has a lot of comedy scenes, this part has far more darker themes, touching important philosophical  aspects such the flaws of humans, their greed and instinctive  need of perpetuating their species, even if that means to make colonies on other planets as well as questions on morality, such as the fear and guilt of killing someone.The anime\\'s primary inspirations are the westerns and science-fiction themes. The science-fiction themes are more subtle, and beautifully depicted, especially the existence of \"the plants\" (which I will not spoil what they are).To be able to save others, to shoulder their pain, in spite of his own sacrifice, that is what this anime\\'s about, what is Vash\\'s character and his journey is about.Story: 9I will begin saying that the mangaka of Trigun Yasuhiro Nightow\\'s character design is very appealing for a 90\\'s anime, especially the desgins of Vash and Wolfwood, which I can observe the mangaka put a lot of care into. The scenary is interesting, especially the existence of the two or more suns. For a late 90\\'s animation it looks rather well-made, even if it couldn\\'t be compared with the recent animation, which wouldn\\'t be fair.Art: 8The soundtrack of Trigun is addicting, varying from the up-beat, action-packed background music, to the heart-felt western music and to the  sorrowful,soothing atmopsheric music, such as Rem\\'s song \"Sound Life\". You may find one of your favorite soundtracks in this anime. Both the opening (\"H.T.\" by Tsuneo Imahori) and ending (Kaze Wa Mirai Ni Fuku byAKIMA & NEOS ) are engaging and enjoyable.Sound: 10The characters are the anime\\'s strongest point in my opinion. Let\\'s start with the character of Vash. First introduced as a goof-ball, it is later revealed he has a heavy burden to carry. Vash is a complex character, full of contradictions, he is afraid if he himself is in danger, but when others are in danger he becomes fearless. He sometimes acts foolish and reckless, but other times he is serious and analytic.  In my opinion, he is also one of the coolest anime characters, on one occasion he wears a trash lid on his head for protection, transforming a comedy scene into an epic one. Vash is unlike any other anime character. What he does no other can do. He lives by the motto : \"love & peace\" , the degree of his self-sacrifce is unmatched. The total opposite of his brother that wants to destroy the human world, Vash chooses to get hurt or worse in order to protect it, because \"they are alive and no one has the right to take the life of another\". The character of Meryl didn\\'t appealed to me but she was neccesary. The character of Milly, the giant girly girl, however was intriguing. At first look she appears scatterbrained and clumsy, but at times shows unexpected wisdom and gives advices and moral support when the characters need it the most. As Vash once stated :  \"The big one [Milly] is exceptionally scary. My only salvation is she doesn\\'t know how sharp she is.\"In episode 9, we are introduced to the character of Nicholas D. Wolfwood, an unusual priest, who can use guns expertly and talks in a kansai-ben dialect (in the japanese version). We see him carrying a huge cross around him everywhere, saying that it\\'s so big because it\\'s full of mercy (the quote I used above). His character portrays the best the human flaws, the perpetual conflict between choosing to do good or doing bad in order to save the good. He is often jealous of Vash\\'s determination of not wanting to kill and always looking for a peaceful alternative.The relationship between Vash and Knives is beautifully depicted in an episode that shows their origins and how they are different from humans. Even though they are twins and grew up together, they choose different paths in life, Vash choosing to follow the human path and to protect them, Knives choosing the path of destruction.The character of Rem rarely shows but has a big impact on the viewer. She is the one that influenced Vash\\'s pacifistic view on life. Even after so many decades, Rem still lives in Vash\\'s memory, guiding him along the way.Characters: 10I highly enjoyed this anime, as a result, I re-watched it, enjoying it even more.Enjoyment: 10Overall: 9I\\'m aware that there are better reviews on MAL for Trigun, I wrote it only to share my opinion on the anime with you.                                      Trigun  トライガン ReviewStory (5/10) AverageAlright I\\'m not going to talk about the countless uninteresting and irrelevant sidestories that the anime had to other through out it\\'s 26 episode run but the main plot which I also found uninteresting and generic anyway. Now I was going to give this anime the benefit of the doubt because of the time it came out when using the word generic but i can\\'t I would be lying to myself if i said \"If I say this back when it aired I would have probably enjoyed it more\" I HIGHLY fucking doubt that. The story of Vash the Stampede                  i found uninteresting because not only have I seen it done before that\\'s not the issue, it\\'s the fact that I couldn\\'t find anything unique or interesting about his whole story which MadHouse I felt it a quite mediocre job explaining the events of what happened through flashbacks that where so far spaced out through out this entire anime that even if cared it amount of fluff and retarded shenanigans in between the actual important things just makes me forget certain important points there where shown off as important in the first place. The pacing I felt was also felt short, as like I stated before this suffers the same thing I felt Cowboy Bebop suffered from which is uninteresting fluff in a 26 episode anime that could have been wrapped up in probably 13 episodes but this does it far worse than Cowboy Bebop. Art and Animation (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.5/10) Now yes the art style and animation in this isn\\'t anything amazing but it\\'s far from bad. This is the late 90s so MadHouse back then aren\\'t the Madhouse they are today. And with that being said for a late 90s anime it\\'s just a little bit better looking than the majority of other things that came out during it\\'s time, nothing expect for the character design and weapon designs really stood out to me, so those are the only two things that saved this category to an extent.Sound (5/10) Mediocre Now other than the Opening OST (Dub not sure if it\\'s the same for the JP nor do i care) the sound for this anime is average. Gun shots sound average (yes I was expecting something above average from a anime called TriGUN when it came to gun sounds obviously Vash had a unique gun \"which they didn\\'t even really go into detail with which also pissed me off\" that sounded no different and your average gun. This is coming from a Gundam fan and if you know anything about Gundam they have unique and distinct sound effect for the more important guns in their series so yes I was expecting something and got nothing). The voice acting was average (Dub) also even though this was Johnny Yong Bosch\\'s first anime big anime character to voice act I personally think this is by far the worst character I\\'ve heard him voice act and I\\'ve heard a few. I don\\'t care if this was the 90s bad voice acting is bad voice acting he obviously becomes better in future roles in my opinion like Ichigo, Lelouch or Yukimura Sananda and like i said this is just his worst out of all of the voices I\\'ve heard him voice act, that doesn\\'t mean it horrendous but just the worst. And as far as the BGM chosen at given times I felt didn\\'t fit most of the time. Example in the last episode with the show down against his brother the OST playing is just no, I have no clue who was in charge of OST but I hope they got fired. And let\\'s not even talk about the Outro music.. probably the worst Outro music I\\'ve heard in anime history.Characters (5/10) AverageThe only characters I even found remotely interesting and not annoying was Wolfwood and the cat (yes the cat..) Everything other character was just straight annoying to no end with uninteresting or no backstory at all. Yes I\\'ve probably used the word uninteresting quite a lot in this review and interesting I guess can be subjective so take it how it is. Nonetheless I felt all the characters were average Enjoyment (4/10) BadHonestly the only enjoyment I got out of this was the opening theme song. After that the enjoyment vanishes. If you\\'ve read this far then you already know what I\\'m word I\\'m about to spam you with uninteresting uninteresting UNINTERESTING, sorry if you\\'ve enjoyed this series than good for you I did not, sure there are worse things out there which is why this is at a 4 and not a 3,2 or 1 but it is what it is.Overall (5/10) Mediocre More Specifically (5.30/10)I\\'ve actually started this series year ago, watched one episode and didn\\'t look back. And all this time I kept hearing about Trigun this and Trigun that (oh yeah they as far as I remember the word Trigun never gets explained, idk it\\'s its the name of his actual gun orrr idk anyway) I always told myself if I actually sat down and watched the anime I probably would like it, well I was sadly mistaken. I\\'ve had my far share of anime that I still have not seen that people consider some of the best/classic anime of all time and the reason I haven\\'t seen them is mostly because this shit right here happens. Another Example is Akira (Nope didn\\'t like that so called Masterpiece either thought it was a hot mess and mediocre at best also). I\\'m just going to chalk this one up to \"I was never a fan of the Gunslinger anime genre and after watch the top 3 most popular/critically acclaimed Gunslinger anime (Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw being the other two) I would definitely consider this one the weakest of the three. But like I said before I\\'m not a fan of this genre so take everything I said with that in mind.                                       mildly annoying and cliche philosophical aspects, has a series identity crisis which makes the show bipolar in thematic focus (eg shifts between silliness and seriousness that are arbitrary and seem to be what you would call \"filler\").  someone making kawaii gestures is not character development, and i think the silliness is probably a good idea but should have been paced differently. this sounds really stupid but i think if the humor would have been paced more like cowboy bebop then this show would\\'ve been a more cohesive experience.  great art and interesting universe. personally i  think the series would\\'ve been much better                  had this been the primary focus initially (not vash\\'s internal conflicts) because it ends up hurting the series early on due to slow character development.                                      This is a good no brainer anime that doesn\\'t require much thought while watching, yet is so silly that it entertains on a primal level.Story: What story? The story consist of pretty much a guy going around kickin the bad guys asses.Art: Not amazingly detail or smooth, but the art matches the silliness of the show with the exagerrated face animations. Classic 90\\'s anime with bright colors and stiff motion, but character designs were great and the environment was well done.Sound: Voice acting was good and characters were distinct, the girls had pretty sexy voices. No real annoying ones either (jap version)Character: Likeable characters, the                  most interesting character happens to be a supporting character who happens to be a priest who carries around this huge cross that\\'s actually a machine gun. Great guilty pleasure viewing there, however; the main character is your typical hero who loses his memory bla bla bla, but he does provide good comic relief and is quite clumsy at times for someone with such a bad ass reputation.Enjoyment: I enjoyed the show\\'s simplicity, but toward the middle into the end i couldn\\'t help but crave a little more depth to the characters and story development.Overall: While no doubt the show oozes with style and charisma, the show lacked enough depth for me to call it a true classic. Good, but not masterpiece worthy, Show felt a bit pointless and silly(silly in a good way)  yet still very enjoyable...nothing more...nothing less.        ment2                              Introduction:I don’t know how to bring up a discussion on violence which is the main theme of “Trigun”. An anime series that goes into depth on the topic of violence and telling a compelling story with a great leading character. Despite the serious theme Trigun is also enjoyable dashing out humor through the course of 24 episodes. It’s as much of an enjoyable show as it is dramatically powerfully. If you’re a fan of Westerns, Madhouse Studio, or like a great leading character Trigun is the show for you.Basic Information:Episodes: 26Available English Dub: YesAnimation Studio: MadhouseGood: Vash The StampedeTrigun is only as it good as                  it protagonist and you couldn’t have asked for a better leading character than Vash the Stampede. He is deliberately introduced as this badass gunmen in the series intro that shows him dodging dozen of bullets from gunmen and wind constantly blowing his way in the lonesome desert getting across an uncanny, seemingly violent figure. Once the first episode starts you only get to know about Vash from secondary accounts that make him out to be this dangerous man. However, when actually seeing Vash for the first time you’ll find it difficult to imagine such a goofball would be worth so much money. That’s one of the main reasons Trigun works. Vash has many characteristics allowing the series to go in different directions once establishing Vash and none is more evident than in his sense of humor. It doesn’t matter how dire the current situation or standoff might be. Vash can come out of it with his goofball side intact. Always seeking to find the best solution in a very limited amount of time when placed on the spot. Vash is a misunderstood hero you probably wouldn\\'t give a second thought towards. When advancing further in the series details slowly revealing Vash background are given. Suddenly there is new meaning behind Vash good nature in the desolate and violent world he lives in becoming more sophisticated. Analyzing the depth of Vash can be an engaging experience all on its own right.Define by his ideology and the constant challenge to stick to it in difficult situations, there is never a moment Vash is not challenged. Because of his pacifist nature, it leads him into trouble in the west from dangerous gunmen. By no means is Vash an incompetent shooter as proven in several episodes he has obtain pitch perfect accuracy. Understandably that would ordinarily make for a boring lead, but because of Vash ethics to not kill anyone it makes every approach to conflict unique. With his beliefs preventing him from simply killing those after him results in creative solutions. Whenever simply shooting a gun off your gunman just doesn’t work, it branches out how the setup will play out. Since Vash ideology prevents him from killing in confrontations will have you wondering what the breaking point will be. Living in a world and people that influence him to think like common folks over achieving peace. What Vash does isn’t simply for survival, but spreading an ideal that he must represent by any means. Good: A Riveting WorldTrigun takes place on a desert like planet named “Gunsmoke” that is cover by sand, decaying cities and towns, and steampunk technology. The world of Trigun is common to overlook in a film, but in the form of a TV series you get a better opportunity to understand and see it developed. It’s not an ideal world to live in. As made evident with the extensive world building that is put into crafting this world. We benefit from seeing Vash travel to different destinations and experience a bit of chaos in that city or town. Each visit gives you insight on how differently people lives are affected by the world they live in. In episode 5, an entire city is attempting to capture or kill Vash in order to save the city from bankruptcy. Immediately you understand that the city is in desperate need of money in order to survive. Hinting that even in a world that’s barren like “Gunsmoke” money still present power over instinctively helping the common man. Within the same episode you get to hear voices lashing directly at Vash to give up his life while Vash on other hand opposes their opposition with reasoning. Needless to say, good nature people doesn’t equal positive decision making. Neither does it mean that a doomsday aftermath will eliminate the rules we currently live by.Trigun takes place on a desert like planet named “Gunsmoke” that is cover by sand, decaying cities and towns, and steampunk technology.

Needless to say, good nature people doesn’t equal positive decision making. Neither does it mean that a doomsday aftermath will eliminate the rules we currently live by.Good: Exploration On ViolenceThe element of violence I keep mentioning is what the series tackles thoroughly. Our protagonist is a pacifist, and those he encounters generally are not in the same mindset. Simply holding all life sacred isn’t as simple as withholding one self from pulling a gun trigger. It’s a perspective that is elaborated upon, even if the answer you received might not be entirely acceptable. Characters in the world will question them with the hero or villain quick to refute their criticism with their own reasons. The philosophy is obvious, but understanding why anyone would stick to their beliefs is difficult to fully grasp or get behind. Sometime it can be as simple as a person who inspired a character or in another case a life that influences choices. As a blunt contrast to Vash we\\'re given the traveling priest and smooth operator Nicholas D. Wolfwood. Despite being a follower of the holy lord, Wolfwood is far more pragmatic in his treatment of human life, and the arguments between him and Vash, as well as Wolfwood\\'s eventual confrontations with redemption, make him a particularly interesting character. He a highlight of the examination of Christians principles. Sure many religions value love of life, forgiveness, and redemption, but clearly Nicholas D. is geared toward the Christian side given Wolfwood background. Am I reading too much into the character? Maybe, although Yasuhiro Nightow (the creator of Trigun) is a known Christian. Much like Vash, we wonder what Wolfwood breaking point would be when it comes to his religion. Can a man who follows the word of the lord really be able to abide by them? The answer to that it provides might come across as clear cut, but much like Vash, there is various shades to each answer given. Another contrast to Vash are Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, who are agents of the Bernardelli Insurance Society sent to evaluate claims regarding Vash the Stampede. In the series they serve the purpose of comedic reliefs as well as being the bridge to natural characterization. The insurance girls are a good pair on the entertainment and story. For me, the relationship between Meryl and Milly evolves from the two simply doing their job to doing what they feel is right. As I see it, this is an evolution to being realistic and adds a subtle take on a working person in the world of “Gunsmoke”. Finding the meaning behind what you do beyond a simple paycheck. What drives a person to keep their job, no matter how dangerous and why. It’s never truly brought to the forefront in the series, which makes it a small nice touch in the background. Passing no judgement on whatever your motivation as it demonstrates sometime the reason can go beyond your judgement as demonstrated with Meryl and Milly following Vash despite the harm they are put into. Good: All Shades of VillainyThe series advances with a villain of the week formula. In nearly every episode has Vash and sometime his company defending themselves from a new super power villain or ordinary thugs. In the very first episode Vash goes up against a large cyborg named Descartes. He possesses a giant cybernetic arm with an attached boomerang. Despite appearances Descartes doesn’t last more than a single episode as Vash easily gets rid of him. Villains personalities are varied offering some that are sympathetic with reasonable motivation while others are solely evil. It’s refreshing to see a series that doesn’t attempt to make every villain come across as a tragic story. Because of this we’re able to see the lowest depths thugs in this desolate planet can sink too. The most memorable confrontations are those that expose a different side of Vash psyche. These intellectual battles require Vash to be a quick thinker to find a peaceful resolution, even though simply shooting the villain is an easy way to survive. Sometime Vash doesn’t even need to use his gun to win making preventing standoffs from becoming stale. One noteworthy villain is Legato Bluesummers. Legato best fits the part of a villain with long blue hair covering one eye and wearing an open trench coat showing off his imposing figure. Smiling when torturing others with his sadistic personality. Ultimately going as far as choosing his purpose in life is to help his master wipe out all of humanity and making Vash as long as possible. When it comes to villains not many within the series can surpass Legato in dedication to his single cruel purpose.Good: A Distinctive Vision The animation is spectacular while the art and the background art isn\\'t wildly creative with the barren, dusty world nearly eliminating scenery variety. On the plus side character designs are classic-yet-memorable, and the quality of the production is always high to carry the story. Vash\\'s spiked blond hair, signature sunglasses, and long, red trench coat, give him a distinctive look as the hero of a Western. Nicholas D. Wolfwood looks suitably cool with his massive, cross-shaped gun makes him among coolest priests in animation. There are impressive over-the-top fights displaying various degrees of bullets piercing and the dynamic gun choreography is always fun to see with superpowers gunmen requiring characters to change tactics. In particular the final standoff, which easily ranks among one of the best choreographed finale to have ever graced animation.Trigun soundtrack is noteworthy from aggressive electric guitar to a few very mellow Western-themed tunes and a pretty song that factors into the story. Supporting a scene instead of telling the audience how they should feel in a particular scene. Like Legato\\'s chaotic industrial-sounding theme that fittingly goes along with Legato even more chaotic nature in mentally torturing Vash.The Japanese and English voice acting is another of Trigun\\'s strong points. Vash goofball side and antics mesh well with the dramatic parts of his persona. Never is one aspect of Vash personality ever become overshadowed by the other. Wolfwood is also smooth, fun, and generally likable sharing many similarities to Vash. Hiromi Tsuru does a great, lively Meryl, although there\\'s not much depth to the role. She\\'s balanced by Milly an equally likable and generally believable when she gets serious. The English dub has none other than Johnny Yong Bosch in the lead role who does an excellent job. Playing up Vash comedic chops during the comedy scenes while always sounding human whenever discussing the value of life. All the actors in the English dub sound natural balancing the vastly different tone that it starts out with to what it eventually becomes. Much of the same praise that can be given to the Japanese cast can also apply to the English voice cast. Either way you can’t go wrong with reading subtitles or watching the English dub.Final Thoughts: Trigun has high brow writing and thoroughly explore themes on violence without shy away from dishing out a sense humor along the way. Coming across as a prime example of how to do gritty story and delivering a meaningful message without having to be serious all the time.

A must see for any fan of great anime, for those looking for intellectual departure, or anyone who likes western.                                      Try to imagine a western sci-fi version of Rurouni Kenshin but more light hearted and you practically got Trigun. Despite how I described it in a nutshell, this series is pretty distinctive in its own rights. A good portion of the series will feel a little episodic like Cowboy Bebop in which this series tends to be compared to, but it does have a big picture to the story. The first half will have that episodic feel where its establishing the characters, while the second half is more focused on Vash&rsquo;s past and the Gung-Ho Gun Men. But in general, the characters whether main on                  minor will all contribute to the overall impact the story has in relation to both its development, and its somewhat generic themes such as the value of life and that people shouldn&rsquo;t kill, but I think this series does an excellent job of presenting it more effectively than Rurouni Kenshin. Kenshin on one hand has a weapon capable of not killing people, but is still powerful enough to cause some permanent damage. But because he still can&rsquo;t kill people and can still cause damage to his opponent, he doesn&rsquo;t have to really hesitate too much in confrontations. While with Vash, he&rsquo;s not really confrontational, and he&rsquo;s willing to take an ass kicking and his principles are so strong that he doesn&rsquo;t want to break them even in self-defense. But moving on, the character development is really tremendous and comes out at a pace that is appropriate in relation to the length of the series. So there&rsquo;s really not too much to complain about with character usage and development. However, I do think the pacing of the story is a bit jumpy. It can be fast, and it can be slow, and sometimes certain aspects can be a bit forced. I think the proper use of suspense in relation to this flaw is what really defines it in both pros and cons I do wish to explore more, but I would have to reveal spoilers. But for the ending, this anime came out during the prime of the manga, and the manga ended not too long ago in Japan. The ending was appropriate for the tone of the anime, but felt more general and out of convenience, and didn&rsquo;t really feel grand to the extent Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s was. Then again, there&rsquo;s the movie to look forward to. I felt the designs of the planet and the clothing were very appropriate to the context of the story, so I think its style in this approach isn&rsquo;t much to really complain about. I think the western setting is very universal despite being of course a Japanese product. Living in what used to be called the wild west, the setting is very much appealing to me. And I think appropriately, the lack of technology except for guns and transportation is still appropriate to that it&rsquo;s both desolate, but yet futuristic and sci-fi. I would point out the flaws, but I can&rsquo;t really be too hard on it because it is relatively an older series, but Cowboy Bebop came out around the same time which is amazing, so what the hell. I felt at times, the eyes looked a little too sketchy, and not really deep with the eye color. The contrast is kind of plain and grainy, but what the hell. Who cares, huh? I felt I needed to say that to bring up a con. Vash&rsquo;s design is pretty cool itself. Granted his hair is generic in the world of anime and manga, but at least you can see him with different hairstyles. Though you will mostly see his hair up, it will be down at times and it kind of makes you think of Benimaru from King of Fighters who has a similar hairstyle. And his red trench coat of course will stand out since most of the colors you will see will tend to be on the lines of black, white, or blue with some of the other clothing and really brings a unique presence to him, and compliments his build. But moving on, the action is pretty much fast paced. It&rsquo;s appropriately stiff and with the smaller and insignificant fights, they will add comedy elements to it with Vash&rsquo;s non-confrontational antics. But with the more serious fights, they are more intense, have a unique novelty and gimmick, which makes them more distinctive, though at less often times there will be comedic moments, but you will see Vash get to shine in these moments. I&rsquo;ll have to say that I really like the dub of this anime. Granted, it&rsquo;s no where near the league of Cowboy Bebop&rsquo;s dub, but it is top notch and tolerable. Every other episode I alternated between Japanese and English. Johnny Yong Bosch as Vash as his breakthrough I thought was excellent in bringing out Vash&rsquo;s serious and childish characteristics in my native language. And the dub actor I had the worst expectations of was Jeff Nimoy as Wolfwood, who is also popular amongst the fan base. I thought he sucked hard as Miyata in Hajime no Ippo, but he was great as Wolfwood, but doesn&rsquo;t make him that distinctive like in the Japanese version with his mannerisms. In the Japanese version, they really made him interesting by speaking in an Osaka dialect. And I felt it was an awkward, but yet fresh role for his seiyuu, Hayami Sho who tends to play more serious and formal characters. I&rsquo;m not used to him in comedy, but he did great. But because the character spoke in an Osaka dialect, so I think that Masaya, the voice of Vash himself, I think would have been better for Wolfwood since he&rsquo;s natively from Osaka, and brought out the badassness of Sendo in Hajime no Ippo, in which that respective character from that anime is an Osaka native. But there&rsquo;s really no official explanation why Wolfwood speaks in Osaka dialect, but I think in that sense, it makes his character more unique rather than being a gun slinging and smoking priest. The music itself is very appropriate to the context and tone of the anime. Lots of guitars whether acoustic or electric are well used to set the atmosphere of the moment. The guitars can be intense in context to either futuristic action, or its laid back frontier setting. So I got nothing much to complain about except it&rsquo;s nothing really as well emphasized on like in Cowboy Bebop with the jazz and the eurobeat in Initial D, but still pretty fun. The opening and ending themes are also top notch and somewhat distinctively inticing. For Hajime no Ippo fans watching this review who have yet to watch Trigun, the opening theme is pretty much a lot like the 3rd opening theme of that respective series with its techno-rock approach. I guess it is appropriate to bring up the similarities both animes share the same composer for the music. What can I say? I believe Trigun deserves every bit of praise it has received over the years, and I can&rsquo;t say that about 75-80% of super popular animes out there. I first watched this anime fansubbed way back in 1999, and enjoyed it. Now 10 years later with the manga finally ended, a game by SEGA that fell into obscurity and with the movie sometime in 2009, I figure I take a trip back memory lane and watch this series again and also give the dub a try. The series still impresses me and I think it will please all anime fans, especially the fans who prefer dubs. I think the anime has a well-rounded and somewhat family friendly atmosphere that is true to its themes, and characters that stand out and all have their use and contributions, which really means a lot to me when I watch anime. And like many others, maybe their scores are in my range in which I give Trigun an overall score of a 9/10.t9                              Trigun has a Western style, where the gunmen and taverns fights are a common scenario. The place where this happens is Planet Gunsmoke, desertic, with the harsh climate, poverty and vandalism.Here appears Vash The Stampede, our main character, a man wanted by the law whose head worth $$ 60 billion. A character who at first seems simple, but it is much more complex and multifaceted than we would believe. It has a great sense of morality and humor.The series combine messages about morality with good humor and action scenes.The characters are well developed, are very human and give the plot a great sensitivity. Guns and                  fights end up in a second plane, to focus on relationships and emotions of each character.Highly recommended if you like science fiction, good plots, and empathetic characters.                                      Trigun follows the story of Vash the Stampede, an expert gunman with a bounty of 60 billion double dollars, and his adventures on a seemingly desert planet as he roams from town to town. He is known as the humanoid typhoon, as wherever he goes, a mess is generally left behind. With all the disasters that follow him, two girls working for an insurance company, Meryl and Milly, have been assigned specifically to report on incidents involving Vash. Though he turns out to be a very different character to what they had expected of the \"dangerous\" outlaw.If this series does one thing brilliantly, I feel                  it would be the characterisation. The main four protagonists (Vash, Meryl, Milly and Wolfwood) all have intricate personalities, generally with two or more sides which they\\'ll switch between, carrying different methods of doing things and have varying takes on similar values. This leads to some very interesting relationships between each of the characters, especially that between Vash and Wolfwood, and is done with such subtlety that makes it seem so natural and it becomes quite engaging to watch, especially when put in comparison to a large portion of other anime, a medium which generally lacks subtlety. The multiple sides to each of these characters also keeps them interesting throughout the series, and there may still be doubt on what actions they will take, despite having watched them closely for several episodes. For example, Vash is an expert gunman, who at times can become deadly serious, though at other times he is a complete goofball doing some of the stupidest things and being bested by children, and throughout the series it is hard to tell which side of him is the real Vash (something which drives Meryl crazy). This is also similar in the case of the other main characters generally showing two sides, and made the show a very interesting watch. Another thing which this anime does great is the clash of ideals and its overall theme. Vash holds a very strong belief that no one has the right to take another person\\'s life, under any circumstances. This is very unusual given his particular set of skills that he possesses. On the other hand, the setting is filled with mercenaries, outlaws and others who would not think twice about killing a person for whatever reasons that they may have. Wolfwood, like Vash, doesn\\'t believe in taking another\\'s life, unless it is absolutely necessary, and although the pair can be the best of friends, this leads to some rather interesting conflicts. I really did enjoy the way the series played around this philosophy though. When is it right to kill another person? Is there a way to save everyone? Does someone always have to die early? It definitely had me thinking a bit as I was watching, and the characters do a great job of personifying some of the different positions. Though at the same time a more passive audience member just looking for a bit more mindless fun would still be able to enjoy the series.You should be warned though that the series does start off rather slow. For the first half it seems to be majority filler, with not much linking between episodes at all, and almost each one could be watched by itself. It was still entertaining to a degree, but I didn\\'t feel like any of it was all too special, and with no real main story being followed, it was at times hard to tell why I was watching it. In the end I just kept watching because I wanted to see where this was going, and there were still a few mysteries around a couple of things that I wanted answers to. This all changed though at episode 12 (and what a great episode that was), which is where things start to pick up and a main story is introduced, so if you do feel that you aren\\'t enjoying the first half so much, I do encourage you to get to that episode and then judge whether you feel its worth finishing the series. It was at this point onwards I realised that the first half was used to establish the characters and setting, which it did well and I began to like it a bit more for its role in the series, but at the same time it did take a while, so it was like half forgiven. Though from episode 12 onwards I have to admit I was rather drawn into the series, where I wanted to know what was going to happen in the next episode. By the end of the show, everything was all tied up quite nicely, without feeling like there were any major plot turns that I found unbelievable or that wasn\\'t well thought out.I also have to commend the series on how it keeps a great deal of mystery around the main characters. I mean, there isn\\'t a single episode where Vash doesn\\'t make an appearance, and yet he is shrouded with mystery about his past and who he really is for the majority of it. The setting is also a fair bit of a mystery as to when and where this takes place, in Sci-Fi, western world.Now onto animation. Ok, there isn\\'t really any use in hiding the fact that the animation quality is rather outdated. That being said though the action is still enjoyable, although nothing too great, and its definitely not something you would watch for the way it looks (I hope, unless it\\'s some kind of nostalgia thing). I feel like what made up for this though (watching an anime made in 1998 in 2015) was some of the unique weapon designs and fighting in the series, some of which were pretty cool and original, especially when you think about how long ago this was made (I mean c\\'mon, bloody Wolfwood\\'s weapon is sick), though at the same time some were a little retarded (*cough* those giant people *cough*). This kept the action interesting for me at least, as otherwise it isn\\'t too flash in comparison to modern animation.It should also be noted that I watched the whole series in the english dub, which I felt was done rather well, and had no major issues with any of it. Don\\'t know about the sub.So in summary, Trigun is an anime with great characterisation of its main characters and some of the other minor characters. It has a slow start but overall does a good job of establishing setting and characters, whilst still having plenty of mystery and a rather engaging main storyline in the second half. The theme of whether someone has the right to take another\\'s life adds an interesting philosophical side to it, leaving enough for you to be actively thinking about it, but isn\\'t too much for those who want to watch a show just for fun. The animation is a bit outdated for its day and age, but this should NOT deter you from watching this series, as overall I felt it was pretty good especially considering when it was made.I give Trigun a 7/10 based on how much I enjoyed it, as I don\\'t feel like it is the greatest series, but definitely did some things incredibly well. Though despite me only rating it a 7, I highly recommend you to watch it as something to say that you have watched, as for its time this series is pretty bloody amazing and is definitely a good anime to have under your belt to tell others that you have seen it. And I\\'m pretty sure you will enjoy it as well :)        nt10                              I\\'m going to be completely honest here; Trigun is one of the greatest anime of all time. Period. It\\'s a serious good watch for anyone who wants a western, sci-fi, comedy, or drama. Hell, if that\\'s how much ground they cover for tone alone, you know this going to be great.Story: 10His name is Vash The Stampede. He is also known as the \"Humanoid Typhoon\". This guy is wanted across this dust ball known as \"Gunsmoke\" for a grand whopping total of 60, 000, 000, 000 Double-dollars. (Whatever the f**k a double-dollar is.) So as the appropriate thing to do with a man\\'s bounty so                  high you can feed your family for life, this dude is swarmed by bounty hunters, rouges, and freaks alike. And really, you can\\'t help but feel sorry for the guy after you learn he\\'s actually a doughnut-loving passifist who just wants to right the wrongs of his past. Of course, the plot kind of starts as an episodic pace, yet we slowly learn of the events of the past and the things haunting him. Until the drastic change of tone halfway into the show. Without spoiling too much, the show becomes incredibly dark and brutal in the second half. Testing your morals and ideals of right and wrong. In the end, Trigun is a story of redemption, and it never tries to stray from that.Art: 7I love classic anime animation, but Trigun\\'s is...alright. The character design looks great. From the badass sunglasses and dustercoat Vash is known for, to the stark comparison of the cruel Legato Bluesummers. But the animation is dated. Especially for it\\'s time and today. It\\'s not bad to look at, but it could easily have been better.Sound:10 Honest to God, this anime has my favorite soundtrack in anime history, and quite possibly the best dub of all time. The soundtrack consists of hard rock, mellow ballads, and saxophones. My personal favorite track is \"Could have been worse.\" A slow mellow track that evolves into a haunting rock ballad. As for the dub, it is in every way a better choice to watch it dubbed rather than subbed.  Shoutout to Johnny Yong Bosch, as this was his first anime role ever, and my GOD he has always had talent. Everyone else does an amazing job in their own right, making this show absolutely brilliant to listen to.Characters: 8Every main protagonist is extremely well writen, with everyone having their own flaws and advantages and disadvantages. But the reason this one is near flawed is for two reasons. One; Vash is essentially Kenshin. They both act nice and have a no killing law, but they both a violent sad pasts that haunt them to this day. However for Vash it was more accidental, which honestly has me prefer Vash over Kenshin. The other flaw being that Vash goes Angst on infinity in the second half, which I\\'m not too big a fan of. Overall: Trigun is just beautiful. If you don\\'t mind the show\\'s outdated animation and the somewhat jarring dark second half, this show is one of the best anime of all time. So guys and gals, do yourself a favor; watch Trigun.                              Trigun was originally a manga by Yasuhiro Nightow that began publication in 1995, and ended, if you count Trigun Maximum as the same series, in 2007. The animated adaptation was made in 1998 by Madhouse Studios, nearly a decade before the manga ended. Despite that, the anime was a success, and I\\'m gonna let you in on a little secret; Trigun is one of the few animes I\\'ve seen wherein I prefer the anime version over the manga original. However, is it really the end all, be all comedy/action everyone makes it out to be? Let\\'s find out.Story:In the future on the planet Gunsmoke, a                  man is wanted for the destruction of property. So notorious is he that he has the highest bounty on record on his head. People say he is not even human, but rather, a natural disaster in human format. We meet this man, this \"Vash the Stampede\", and learn that he is . . . a complete and utter dork. And a pacifist. And yet, he is a crack shot with his revolver. How can that be? Vash is a wanderer who helps people on his travels without killing anyone at the same time, (which is extremely difficult to do in this series.) He is aided by two women from an insurance agency, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson. At times, a man named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, a priest armed to the teeth, also travels with him. These other characters are eccentric in their own ways.The first half of the anime series is largely comedic, and while sequential, does not have an over-arcing storyline tied to it. The second half of the series is more serious, and does have an over-arcing storyline. I like both halves of the series. When it\\'s funny, it\\'s usually funny, and when it\\'s serious, it\\'s usually serious. Many of the action scenes are great. However, not all episodes are great; some are much more enjoyable than other, but overall, Trigun does not disappoint here. 8/10.Artwork:Despite common criticisms, this series actually looks pretty good for a retro 90s anime series. The action scenes are well animated. The backdrops give a good impression of how dusty the world of Gunsmoke is. The character designs are not some of the best I\\'ve seen, but it, as well as everything else, is LEAGUES beyond the manga\\'s artwork, which looks piss-poor in my honest opinion, especially compared to the anime. I like the coloring too, especially for a pre-digital anime. Trigun might not look as sharp as some newer anime, but the animation during the action scenes more than makes up for it. 8/10.Sound:The music is great. It\\'s very, uh, well, it\\'s very American sounding. But it\\'s really good. It feels like an old western movie in this regard, but done with country and rock instruments instead of an orchestra. Both the intro and endings songs are fantastic. No complaints here.I saw the series in English, and . . . I\\'m surprised. A lot of dub watchers champion Trigun as one of the best English dubs ever. I honestly can\\'t say it\\'s that good. Granted, many of the major characters, such as Vash, Milly, Wolfwood, Rem, and recurring villain Legato do sound good. However, I cannot stand Meryl\\'s voice and delivery. Also, many of the minor characters sound irritating as Hell. I think the only reason this dub is so beloved is, well, I guess it was either this in English, or . . . Pokemon. Compared to THAT, yeah, it would sound good in English. I will say this, though; I compared Vash\\'s voice in Japanese. He sounds better in English. And you wonder why people (myself included) worship Johnny Yong Bosch. 9/10.Characterization:Vash is a hardcore pacifist in spite of his asskicking abilities in combat. At times, he behaves like a character from a Hanna and Barbera cartoon, yet other times, he\\'s dead serious. I like him. Wolfwood is someone who shoots first and asks questions never, and is not afraid to kill, despite Vash\\'s constant protests. I like him, too. But the only character I really liked was Legato. He was the most menacing villain in the series, as well as the most evil, in my opinion. Oddly enough, he wasn\\'t the final bad guy. The other characters, I couldn\\'t really get into. I didn\\'t care for Meryl and Milly, most of the minor characters didn\\'t leave an impression on me, and most of the villains felt like stereotypical one-note villains instead of being really memorable. Even the final villain, Knives, pales compared to Legato. However, this isn\\'t to say the characterization  was bad overall. I liked seeing Vash and Wolfwood team up to take on all the different opponents they faced, and if you\\'ve seen the entire series, you should understand why I consider Legato to be one of the best villains in anime history. 7/10.Enjoyment:When Vash and/or Wolfwood were doing something awesome, I really liked this. And even when they weren\\'t, I still overall liked this series. The narration sequences at the end of every episode were very insightful and philosophical. There were a few scenes that made me laugh, and a few scenes that were hard-hitting. The ending was not a brilliant ending by any means, but there is one thing about it I like; Vash stays true to his ideals until the very end. 8/10.But I still don\\'t understand the hype for this series. It\\'s good, but not that good. The English dub is overall above average, but it\\'s not god-like. There\\'s three cool characters, but that\\'s it. What is with the hype? The one person I know in real life who\\'s seen Trigun was like, \"ZOMG! ZOMG! ZOMG! I LOVE TRIGUN! ZOMG! ZOMG! ZOMG! WHY CAN\\'T MORE ANIME BE LIKE THIS!? ZOMG! ZOMG! ZOMG!\" (Not his exact words, but a pretty close approximation.) I think my problem is I saw this about three years ago, instead of when it first came out. If I first saw Trigun back when all the anime you could watch in America were that, Pokemon, Dragonball Z, and Yu-Gi-Oh, yeah, I probably would be a lot more fanboy-ish right now. However, if you\\'ve never seen Trigun, go ahead and watch it. You might like it more than me, and you\\'d be watching something that\\'s better than the large majority of schlockfests coming out right now. And lastly, this is one of the few \"Classic\" anime I\\'ve seen that didn\\'t immediately piss me off, and actually is something of a classic in my mind.LOVE AND PEACE!        t10                              Ah, Trigun. It is a sci fi western anime that wss more popular in the west than in the east. It is one of my favorite anime, and, in my opinion, for good reason.Story:8/10 The story of Trigun is quite a clever one, using a walking contradiction as our main character. This leads to many dramatic plot points in the story, mainly in the second half. You are always curious about what has happened in Vash\\'s life, and what happened to to make him a wanted man. The only problem with the story is that the pacing in the first half can be very slow,                  with a few episodes in the first half wasting time. While it\\'s not too much of a bother, it still was slightly irritating.Art:7/10 The art of Trigun is my main complaint. It s extremely dated, which draws many fans of new anime away from it. It also doesn\\'t help that there is barely any background. However, the design of the characters is quite good for an anime from 1998, give or take. There is lots of detail put into them, which is very nice. So, it\\'s kind of half and half.Characters:10/10 This is where the show really shines. Every character is useful and interesting, whether they be main or minor, and they are what keep you hooked to the show Vash is my favorite anime character of all time. All of these characters have distinct personalities that you will remember for ages.Sound:10/10 Perfect soundtrack and dub, not much else to say.Enjoyment:10/10 It\\'s one of my favorite anime, what do you expect?Overall: I love Trigun, and think it is near perfection, other than slow episodes and dated animation. I give Trigun a 9/10.                                      When thinking of Trigun, the first thing that comes to mind is \"overrated\". It isn\\'t bad, but it\\'s not nearly as good as the hype would suggest. Story: 7/10The story of Trigun is actually fairly original for anime. The concept of the Space Western is severely underutilized in nearly all mediums, so I was glad to see this. The episodes are generally well paced for an action show, and the old western cliches are used in a way that makes them feel fresh. Nothing terribly wrong with it, but nothing great either.Art: 9/10Unquestionably Trigun\\'s strongest point, the action feels unique and visceral.The thrilling sequences didn\\'t                  really get old for the most part, and that is the mark of good choreography.Sound:6/10The voice acting for the most part seemed fairly generic(with the notable exception of Vash\\'s VA, who turns in a stunning performance that greatly aids the comedy of the show). The sound effects also seemed fairly forgettable.Character:6/10Here was my biggest problem with the series. With the exception of Vash and Wolfwood, everyone was really generic. Milly is a tsundere with a gun, Meryl is a bossy girl, etc.,etc. The fans seem to hold Vash up as a stunningly original character when he\\'s obviously not. Kenshin was around a year before him. I don\\'t mind similarities in characters, but it felt like fans of One Piece holding up Luffy as the most original character in the universe.Enjoyment:6/10The series felt as if it could be better done as a comedy, as it\\'s comedic moments were excellent, and a comedy doesn\\'t place nearly as much focus on characterization. Honestly, the series just never clicked for me.Overall:7/10This series is a good watch for fans of frantic action and/or the space western style setting. It\\'s a solid action piece and really nothing more.                              \"I\\'m just killing the spiders to save the butterflies.\"1998 saw three popular shows going down the unusual route of combining futuristic sci-fi and cowboy-filled westerns as the backdrop to their story. \"Cowboy Bebop\" stands out as the biggest name amongst the trio, while \"Outlaw Star\" has all but faded into distant memory. Sandwiched between them is \"Trigun\", which made a big splash, but never quite achieved the evergreen status of \"Cowboy Bebop\".I\\'d heard about \"Trigun\" being similar to \"Cowboy Bebop\", but personally I don\\'t think the similarities stretch much beyond the marriage of sci-fi and westerns settings. If anything, it\\'s \"Rurouni Kenshin\" that \"Trigun\" share                  a strong connection with, and I\\'m surprised that this connection doesn\\'t get spotlighted nearly as often as the Trigun-Bebop one. Like Kenshin, Vash, the protagonist of \"Trigun\" , wanders from place to place, hiding his power levels under a goofy exterior; like Kenshin, Vash is also a stubborn pacifist, refusing to kill even those who try to kill him. Despite all of this, the ginormously misunderstood Vash has a $$60,000,000,000 bounty over his head, along with unwanted nicknames such as \"Vash the Stampede\" and \"The Humanoid Typhoon\". Luckily for him, his reputation might be fearsome, but no one actually knows what \"The Humanoid Typhoon\" looks like, and this allows him to move around more or less freely.Until trouble inevitably catches up with him, that is.The earlier portions of \"Trigun\" are episodic, and mostly starts off with two insurance companies employees Meryl and Millie going to a town looking for this \"Vash the Stampede\" fellow, intending to keep an eye on him and hopefully prevent him from doing massive damage to buildings and costing their company money. Of course, they would end up running into Vash without realising his identity, Vash would accidentally find himself in the middle of a big ruckus, and the town would go up in smoke.There are reasons aplenty why I shouldn\\'t have liked \"Trigun\". For starters, I don\\'t dig the art style - there are some impessive character design concepts, but mostly it just looked ugly to me. Also, a lot of episodes are formulaic, particularly the early ones. Then there\\'s the comedy - I first watched \"Trigun\" in my budding days of being an anime fan, and back then the silliness of anime humour often got on my nerves. But in spite of all these barriers, I took an instant liking to \"Trigun\". Its writing is solid, and the show mixes comedy and serious business so effectively that I didn\\'t mind its silliness; and in fact, the sharp contrast between goofball Vash and serious Vash really adds to the show. Still, there are times when the comedy goes overboard, like when Vash does his \"love and peace\" routine, which I find unbearable.\"Trigun\" undergoes a drastic change in the second half. The series shifts into a darker tone, and the episodic format changes into an overarching story about Vash\\'s struggles against Knives, a figure re-emerging from his shadowy past. The bad guys up until this point had been weaklings, but now far stronger ones had started to appear, and the battles began to take on qualities not too dis-similar from those in the super power fighting genre. Though the elements are well executed, some viewers will prefer the lighter action/goofier mix earlier in the series. Personally though, I enjoyed the more continuous story and the more interesting battles.The second half of \"Trigun\" encompasses both the best and the worst of the series. On one hand, there\\'s a lot more plot to be found, as well as some of the coolest characters in anime like Wolfwood and Legato. On the other hand, a lot of stuff were never fully explained; questions marks looming over things like the nature of plants (not those plants!) and the motivations and backgrounds of the Gun-Ho Guns are never resolved.Perhaps the aspect I liked the most was finding out more about Vash\\'s past. His relationship with Rem was especially memorable, allowing insights into the major influence on his character, which is in turn reinforced as we see more of his actions and choices later on. At the same time though, this also relates closely to the aspect of the show I have the most problems with: the philosophy with which Vash - and to a lesser extent, Rem - approaches life, and in particular its contrast with that of the antagonist, Knives\\'. Knives isn\\'t your average power hungry villain who wants to take over the world, or goes around killing everyone just because he\\'s crazy. In fact, he\\'s so rational that he makes Vash look incredibly juvenile. While Vash wants to save everyone, Knives reasons that to save the butterfly, you have to kill the spider. It\\'s all well and good having a villain who speaks sense, but when the villain speaks so much more sense than the hero, when the hero has no comeback to the villain\\'s words, then there is something fundamentally wrong with what the series is trying to say. What\\'s also mightily frustrating is the inconclusive ending. True to his self-conflicting philosophies to the end, Vash takes a course of action that doesn\\'t really solve anything in the long term. After all that, nothing really changed. It surely ranks up there as one the worst endings in anime.\"Trigun\" could have been a mediocre anime, for its formulaic format and stale story elements. \"Trigun\" could have been a great anime, for hurdling its potential stumbling blocks with awesome characters and superb execution of the aforementioned stale story elements. In the end though, it\\'s held back by flaws in its story and philosophical ideals, and has to settle for being very good.         9                              Long before I had ever heard of Trigun, I had often seen that famous figure shrouded in mystery: gun in hand, shades on, wearing a long red trench coat. I always wondered who this impressive guy was and what anime he comes from; little did I know he is also the biggest dork ever created...Vash the Stampede the man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head? Or the goofy blonde guy that plays tag with kids and loves donuts? I feel as though I know Vash like a brother, yet also not at all. Throughout the series you delve                  deep into his past, but still he never fails to surprise you. Vash\\'s beliefs and actions are often questioned by anime fans worldwide (myself included), however it is impossible to not be inspired by his righteousness. He is without a doubt the best part of Trigun. The show\\'s side-characters and antagonist on the other hand, all hold their own alongside Vash, though primarily they are there to highlight his many facets. Accompanying him on his journey in the anime are Meryl and Milly, who work for an insurance company sent to evaluate the destruction caused by Vash the Stampede. Whilst providing the majority of Trigun\\'s more comedic scenes they are somewhat forgettable in the grand scheme of things. The one side-character in particular that made a lasting impression on me though was Nicholas D. Wolfwood: a priest wielding an enormous cross filled with an assortment of machine guns, pistols and even a rocket launcher. Despite his unique equipment it is his persona that really appeals to me. Wolfwood\\'s first appearance in the anime made little impression, but by the end of Trigun I was hooked on his hard exterior and contrasting interior. Alongside each other Vash and Wolfwood provide some of the best action, intrigue and even comedy; they are an unlikely duo that should be given more spotlight in the annals of anime.If the opening few episodes don\\'t do it for you (personally I was already hooked), then I cannot stress enough that you must persevere. The story may start somewhat lighthearted, filled with gags and humour, but I see it purely as a channel to set the scene and begin its development. It is around the halfway point that Trigun really begins to show its true colours, introducing a much darker side that is only touched upon in the previous few episodes. The story unravels to give us much more of an insight into the dystopian Wild West setting and more importantly so, into Vash\\'s mysterious past. In my opinion, the second half of Trigun is much better as far as the story is concerned. Not that the first half is not enjoyable, however I thought the latter stages really gave me something to sink my teeth into. The action scenes pick up, along with a rise in intrigue which keeps the excitement building till the very end. Now, despite Trigun\\'s ending being bombarded with criticism, I deeply loved it. Yes, ok, it does leave questions unanswered, but I see that as a good thing - a way to keep us viewers thinking.Trigun was originally aired in 1998, therefore the animation and artwork are somewhat poor compared to standards today. This does not necessarily detract from the shows excellence though. If anything Trigun\\'s often over exaggerated and comical scenes are made somewhat more appealing at times due its animation and art. Some of the designs for the minor characters aren\\'t all that great, but the focus put on its protagonists and antagonists really make up for it - Vash in particular, being visually one of anime\\'s coolest characters ever. Primarily, Trigun is all about its characters. No, Trigun is all about Vash. An underrated character in an even more underrated anime. The large fan base it does have is not nearly enough. Whether or not the original writer, Yasuhiro Nightow, meant for his series to be so character focused, I am not so sure. What I am sure of though, is Trigun is an anime classic, with a protagonist so awe-inspiring that he does actually warrant his $$6,000,000,000 bounty just for being so damn cool.                                       A goofy, sci-fi western dramedy that suckers you into thinking it\\'s just that before pulling the rug out from underneath you in the final third and hammering you relentlessly with some truly bleak entertainment that rivals Neon Genesis Evangelion and Puella Magi Madoka Magica for unpleasantness. And you know what? It\\'s a good thing that it does. Allow me to explain.Trigun concerns itself with one Vash the Stampede, a legendary trouble-maker with a massive bounty on his head. Destruction follows in his wake, with entire cities turning to ruin after he shows up. It\\'s not long before the viewers catch onto the fact that this                  is not entirely his fault, however. Instead, it all really comes down to him having been at the wrong place in the  wrong time at one point in his past, followed ever thereafter by a zealous horde of bounty hunters (sometimes the entire population of towns) who wind up causing more calamity than he does in their attempt to catch him and claim the reward. Vash himself is very much a pacfist. While he does resort to violence if necessary, he never shoots to kill, and will go to incredible lengths  to insure the well-being of his opponents and to prevent fatal conflict between other parties, often at the cost of extreme physical harm to himself. On his journeys he develops relationships with several others who become recurring companions, foremost among them the traveling preacher/fellow gunslinger Nicholas Wolfwood, and Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, two insurance agents who are assigned to watch over Vash and prevent him from getting into destructive situations that their employer will ultimately have to pay for.  Goofy antics ensue, and continue largely unabated until one of the best anime villains in existence shows up, Legato Bluesummers. Bluesummers (and his employer) have dark intentions for Vash that go far beyond claiming the bounty on his head, and I would not dream of spoiling them. What I will say is that Vash\\'s pacifism is shaken to its core, particularly as he comes to the realization that it may cost more lives than it actually saves. In one stunning and disturbing scene, we also see the high price that years of putting himself into harm\\'s way to prevent people from killing one another has done to his body: it puts Kenshin\\'s attractive facial scar to shame, to say the least.This is the good thing that I mentioned above in first paragraph: while the mood whiplash this series undergoes is extreme, to say the least, it also does not shy away from exploring the darker side of pacifism, which is rarely touched on to this same level in anime. It makes for powerful, if dark viewing. On top of which the series is not afraid to kill major characters, or to let the bad guys win. Unfortunately, there are a lot of problems with this series: the early episodes tend to be pretty weak, the cheap animation budget ensures that there are loads of continuity errors to pick up on, and the explosive ending, while viscerally satisfying, does little to tie up the thematic concerns of the series. On top of which Vash is a hero that not everyone will appreciate. While it is revealed that his easy-going, thick-headed goofball nature is largely something of a front, he\\'s still a very emotional, very one-track minded character, which can lead to him sometimes being a joy to watch, while other times you\\'ll just feel like slugging him good. Still, this is a 90\\'s classic for a reason (did I mention the fantastic voice-acting and score?), and while it hasn\\'t aged as well as others, it\\'s still very much worth watching for modern audiences.         9                              Trigun: Just watch it to say you have.  It\\'s one of those *must-watch,* with it being in the same league as Bebop and Evangelion.  So do it.  Regardless, even though it\\'s so old, I will do my best to describe why this show is so good without spoiling anything. ^_^ Story:My tip: ONLY READ THE SYNOPSIS HERE ON MAL.  The synopses on the various sites, in my opinion, give a way a bit too much.  In any case, the story is great because what it sets out to do is slowly build the world around the characters without telling you,                  the audience, anything about it.  You\\'re left to figure everything out about the universe on your own just by observing the situations our MCs get themselves into. It\\'s not convoluted enough to the point where you\\'d need someone to explain it to you, but it\\'s complex enough to be believable as its own living, breathing world.  Trigun\\'s subtlety in unraveling its world and revealing its lore is one of my favorite things about the show.  Even if the show feels super light-hearted and it seems like you\\'re just watching filler, pay attention.  It all matters, and that\\'s what\\'s so great about Trigun.  Also, cool shit like relevant Biblical allusions, Christ imagery, Science vs. religion, morality vs. survival of the fittest, the show gets heavy with problems and it\\'s pretty great.  Characters: The same amount of detail is given to character development and even character design.  For example, the entire point of Vash the Stampede\\'s character as stated by the synopsis is that he\\'s a supposedly extremely dangerous outlaw even though he\\'s characterized as a pretty wonderful person in his own right.  You start off with this two sided character and can\\'t help to wonder what earned him his name and reputation.  His development and its reveal to the audience is subtle and gradual, not to mention extremely satisfying.  Talking about two-sidedness, that even delves down to his design of the red coat and glasses, reminiscent of Hellsing and basically any demon character.  If he is such a wonderful person, why does he, by design, look like a demon?  It\\'s this two-sidedness that is present in Vash as well as all the other MCs as well as the setting itself that makes Trigun so intriguing.  Except Meryl.  She\\'s typical tsundere for no reason and I don\\'t like her.  Someone please prove me wrong and tell me she has a reason for being tsundere because she\\'s the only aspect of this show that I don\\'t like.  Art: Character design works in tandem with character development, and you\\'ll see this in action as the show progresses.  Setting design is minimal yet meaningful.  It plays a huge role in characterizing the setting, alluding to something bigger than itself without giving everything away.  While the animation may not be so smooth and the art style a bit dated, everything still works to convey what it wants to, from superficial actions to visual metaphors and other *beneath the surface* things the show tries to convey.  Sound:I can say the same thing for the sound as I did with the art.  Even the OST plays its part in world building.  Sound effects are meh, but again, 90s.  Finally, watch the English dub.  It\\'s really good and contextually, makes a lot more sense because there is a scene where Vash needs to read Japanese and can\\'t read it.  And also the majority of characters are white.  So do that. Enjoyment and overall: Generally, I loved how all the parts of Trigun worked so well with each other to build this world and these characters and convey its themes and all that good stuff.  If anything, it took me a while to get into.  Get past the first 3 episodes and maybe you\\'ll get hooked.  That\\'s the amount of time that it took me and once you get hooked, it only keeps pulling you in closer.  As for the ending which apparently people didn\\'t like, I thought it was fine.  It was a spectacle to watch with top notch Bebop level animation, as well as some of the highest tension you\\'ll find in anime as you witness a pure fight between men that evolves into something much greater, all with no music behind it.  I personally love the ending, but people may tell you otherwise.  I give it a 9 because of Meryl T_TI highly recommend it though.  It does deserve its title as one of the must-watch anime.  ^_^-MSYN                                      STORY: 5Since I haven\\'t read the manga I don\\'t know if this is a common problem. The story in Trigun is simply bad: it\\'s the story of the feared criminal (though we find out he is not that much of an outlaw) Vash the Stampede, a devastator of cities who has a ridiculously large bounty on his head. Eventually, we discover that he has a pretty big score to settle with his twin brother Knives, and that\\'s it basically. There are little to no explanations for the majority of the questions the plot arises, plot developement seems to be strictly forbidden for the most part                  (seriously, the actual progression of the story occours in just a bunch of episodes), plot twists and unexpected revelations (the rare times they do take place) seem to be thrown at the viewer randomly... the list continues. Episodes are, for the most part, self-concluding little stories which show the adventures of Vash and his friends, and they are quite enjoyable! But the actual plot? It has a lot of flaws impossible not to notice if you abandon the nostalgia effect for a moment.ART & SOUND: 7/8From an artistic POV, Trigun does a fairly good job: the anime has an engaging steampunk design which mixes spaghetti western with a more typically Japanese vision of technology and fantastic elements. Even though the art is fairly essential, it has a lot of personality and effectiveness. Overall, design and animation are fairly outdated, and even though this could contribute to the vintage atmosphere of the show it could be a letdown for others. Character design is simple and good, effectively giving to our protagonists a distinct identity.The music, in Trigun, is great: once again it draws inspiration from western movies and from the renowed composer Ennio Morricone. It activel contributes to the atmosphere, with an amazing use of the instrumentation (which includes harmonicas, acoustic guitars, double basses, but also more modern instruments such as electric guitars and the likes). The overall level of quality is high, even though not \"would listen often when not watching the show\"-high (with a few exceptions, like the opening and Rakuen). Speaking of the sound effects, they also have a vintage feeling to them, and their quality is good because they don\\'t ever feel outdated but, as I said, vintage. As a final note, Italian voice acting is FANTASTIC, especially regarding Vash and Wolfwood.CHARACTER: 6Generally speaking, characters are not that memorable. Vash is undoubtely a great and interesting protagonist, as he is a pacifist gunman constantly struggling to retain his morals in a world in which the strong survives and the weak is pinned down. He has a number of weaknesses and obstacles to overcome as he remains coherent with himself. Its level of characterization is high and he is a strong point of the show. The other only really good character (to me, the best) is his friend Nicholas D. Wolfwood. He is a polar opposite of Vash, because even though he is a priest he doesn\\'t hesitate to kill and commit criminal actions in order to survive in the harsh planet Gunsmoke. His relationship with Vash is deep and effective, and it culminates in what is arguably the most thought-provoking and emotional moment of Trigun. We then have Meryl and Milly, two mildly enjoyable support characters who travel with Vash throughout his journey, first for business reason and then for something else. The villains, though, range from \"okay at best\" to \"downright terrible\": Knives, the main villain, is the best of the category, though heavily cliché\\'d; Vash\\'s twin brother, he thinks that he and his brother, as superior beings, should extinguish humanity and rule over the planet. I heard that in the manga his reason are better explained: good, because in the anime he starts as a \"normal\" kid and goes crazy with no apparent reason, with all the troubles that follows. The last mildly appealing character is Legato, Knives\\' right arm. The organization of villains if full of bit players not even worth to mention.ENJOYMENT: 8Despite the big flaws, Trigun is a highly appealing anime, because the often self concluding episodes are packed with fun, adrenaline and morals in an effective mixture that charms the viewer and makes him watch more and more episodes in one sitting. The balancing is spot on most of the time, with intense action sequences followed by gags and emotional moments in the best way. Speaking of which, episode 23 (Paradise) is a masterpiece. Simple as that, it\\'s the best episode of Trigun because of the final, unforgettable sequence. Ready your handkerchiefs and prepare to cry a lot. Other episodes are not as good, and not masterpieces in their own right, but as I said the rhytm is so engaging that you\\'ll find yourself watching three or four episodes in one sitting most of the time. There are no really dull moments to be found, but also no amazing moments (aside from the one I mentioned), preventing this category to score a 9.Overall, you should watch Trigun, but be wary of its several flaws especially in plot and characters department. Fortunately, they are not the main driving force of the show and so they won\\'t prevent you to enjoy the run.                                      Hello everyone this is Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and welcome to my final review of the month MVM entertainmentFor this one we are taking a look one of the classic 90s animes Trigun.Now before I start this review am going to say I wasn\\'t a fan of Trigun during my childhood days in fact I kinda hated it to be honest. While I like some things of Trigun I didn\\'t like like the tone shifts and I didn\\'t some of characters. Now I recently finished re-watching Trigun on DVD and well.Do I now think Trigun is a great classic show that I underestimated back then or                  do I still think Trigun is a an another 90s shows that only got its love because of nostalgia reasons instead of being a good show? Well let\\'s find out Story.The story of Trigun follows Vash the Steampede who is a wanted criminal with a sixty billion double dollar bounty on his head. The reason is that he’s a deadly villain who lays wastes to that those that appose him and destroying cites just for fun that earns him the title the humanoid typhoon. He leaves a trail of death and despair wherever he goes.Due to Vash\\'s destruction the Bernardelli Insurance Society tasks Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson to find the Vash the Steampede in order to evaluate insurance claims and attempt to minimise the damage of that set city.Now the story of Trigun is complex at times. While the story was very silly, goofy and cheesy in the first half of the show but once you the show transactions to the second left by introducing certain elements in the show. The show becomes rather dark and it can go into really dark territory at times. Also, this show has some tone changes. However, unlike other animes such as Shigatsu and Akame ga Kill where they have problems at tone changing. I think this one fits because you can tell they could juggle both ones and they work both ways in both series. So, I think Trigun doesn\\'t fall in the same traps of other anime of its kind. Also, yes I know this show has a few unanswered questions and there is one or two plotholes but overall in the long running schemes of things. Unless you want to read the source material of this you don\\'t need those answers. The show is trying to portray the story that it wants to and it does it almost flawlessly.1109.5/10 Characters.The characters of Trigun are really good in my opinion.Am just going to say this right now Vash The Steampede is one of my favorite anime protagonist in any anime. He can be really funny at times with his humour but the same time he can be a utter badass. Not to mention his characterization is just wonderful seeing him transform from a friendly joker to a very deadly killer who has a bunch of emotional problems.Overall Vash The Steampede is a great and lovable character.Next up we have the insurance girls Miley and Meryl. I really like these two because I feel they are very genuine with the emotions and also they honestly a great duo and great comic relief characters.Lastly we a character that not interlude until episode 8 Wolfwood who is a priest with a very good of fire arms and very much a boil to Vash.While Vash is one of my favourite anime protagonists Wolfwood is one of my favourite anime characters’ period and to be honest he made Trigun a much better experience especially on my re-watch of the series.  Not to mention I really adore his personally and motivations in general. Overall I really adore Wolfwood The rest of the beyond those four are really good and they made the world harsh but understandably harsh to some degree. You can believe some of the stuff that people do despicable or kinda as they are and you will defiantly feel for them and in the current mindset.Overall the characters in Trigun are really great.9.5/10Art/Animation.Unfortunately, the visuals of Trigun are not that great at all.If you compare shows like Cowboy Bebop, Outlaw Star, Slayers, Nadesico and Fushigi Yuugi Trigun didn\\'t aged as well.There are some spotty scenes that you can tell the budget was probably running out. Not to mention Trigun re-used animation at times. It\\'s not as bad as something as Sailor Moon or Gundam Wing but still kinda of an issue even for its time.It didn\\'t bother me too much but I know it can bother some viewers especially the younger ones so I just thought I would mention it and it was one big flaw that I have with Trigun in general Overall the visuals were kinda lacking 6.5/10Sound.Am going to be real honest I wasn\\'t a fan of Trigun soundtrack. While the soundtrack of Trigun was good on its own and it fits the western theme of the show I just don\\'t find the soundtrack of Trigun to be impactful compare to other anime from the 90s.Don\\'t get me wrong the soundtrack for Trigun is good but for me I won\\'t be listening all the time.The opening theme is a good listen as it hypes up the episode and while the ending theme of Trigun is mediocre and kinda forgettable and not to mentions its really out of place. Now for Dub or Sub.The dub for the show is top notch for the most part. While voice actors for the main characters were great some of the side characters were kinda stiff in my opinion.Also, the dub can be a bit cheesy at times especially the first half.Overall Trigun has a good dub but it\\'s not as impactful as the dubs for Cowboy Bebop and Slayers in my opinion.7/10Final Thoughts.Trigun is a great show. While I may prefer Cowboy Bebop and Outlaw Star Trigun this series is over the top fun and emotional gripping.It has a great revenge story that is well told, great and loveable characters, decent visuals along with a soundtrack that I was not a fan off but still was pretty good for what it is.I use to hate this show when I was younger but now I can say is I adored this show and now it become a favourite of mine. Like they say all re-watches are powerful. I give Trigun a 8/10Anime recommdations Cowboy Bebop Outlaw StarGun x SwordGungraveRurouni Kenshin Black Cat Gun x Sword Anyway, this was Shawn aka TheKazeTrigger and I will see you guys next time.        0                              Don\\'t let the show deceive you with the \"goofy childish hero\" look that it provides at the start (i already saw someone quit it after the first episode because it does look kind of childish). This anime is definitely a lot more mature than it first looks to be. It was based on a manga (like most anime), but it changed the chronological order of it as well as a few other things to make the manga that was already good, into pretty much a masterpiece. The anime starts with an exposition that pretty much tells us nothing about the main hero, except the fact                  that he is the most wanted and dangerous criminal in the world, just to show the most nice guy possible, and make you wonder what got him that name in the first place. This, as well as the environment that pretty much gives off a feeling of a \"wild west\" type of show (maybe with a few steampunk elements thrown in), just adds to the enjoyment and interest when you understand how wrong you where, when it turns out to actually be sci-fi, as you start to understand what\\'s really going on and the pieces start coming together.The only bad things i can say about it is that the colors and animation is a bit outdated, yet it still looks very good non the less. Final verdict- this one, is a must watch for anyone that likes sci fi.        t9                              I\\'ll be open: I\\'m heavily biased to this anime/manga due to the themes it explores hitting very close to home; I was sexually assaulted at a young age, and when asked by the police if I felt any murderous animosity towards my attacker, I said no. I said no because of how the morals in this anime helped me escape a seemingly never ending cycle of depression. So take what I say with a grain of salt. This is also my first review on this site so expect sloppy prose.Story: 7.For any aficionado of the sci-fi genre, Trign\\'s story is a tried and true one:                  (minor spoilers ahead) humans escape a dying Earth to colonize another planet, and another alien presence is trying to finish off humanity. Trigun breaks the mold a bit though by pacing the revelations of the story with the personalities and morals of the characters with comedy being the focus in the beginning and getting much more serious in the end. This is what makes this show a little niche, as the tonal shift from comedy to heavy character drama can turn people who liked the comedy away, or people who don\\'t like the way the story progressed from there as a show of convoluted morality away. Art: 9 The character designs in this show are extremely iconic, Vash the Stampede is an immediately recognizable character for many anime fans. The backgrounds are often static images of grayed out desert, but it fits the world nicely. the dub is also one of few anime dubs to rival (though not quite beat) that of Cowboy Bebop\\'s.Sound: 10Tseuno Imahori\\'s music he provided to this series pulls you in much better than the artwork does. It has a very wide range of tracks and is quite brave in what it decides to implement: glitch tracks, noise music, and heavy emphasis on percussive impact.Character: 10This is where a lot of people can lose interest in this show quite quickly; the characters are dichotomous. Vash hides his depression with a smile and goofy behavior, Milly hides her desire for love with an innocent, almost childlike demeanor, and Meryl is a tsundere who develops into a motherly character towards Vash near the end of the series.If this style of character appeals to you, you should watch this show right now, if it sounds trite and lazy, I\\'d recommend something else.Enjoyment: 9I enjoyed this anime through and through, even when the frames of animation ground to a halt, or when the series shifted in tone. The action is fast paced and creative, the jokes are great, the characters are unforgettable.Overall: 9This is often heralded as a classic, and deserves the title, but is not without its flaws. If you like its style, then this anime might easily become one of your favorites.                                         Warning this review may contain spoilers.First impression, so my first thoughts while going into this show. Where along the lines of man this is going to be a pretty decent sci-fi western action show that was a staple of the late 90s and for the most part it was.Story, 6/10So the story of trigun is fearly straight forward  and simple.It pretty much about the cool and wacky  adventures of  vash the stampede Who is a super hacked gunslinger that goes for pacifism and who has a reputation for being the most dangerous person alive on the planet.  Just before I get                  into more details I will have to mention that the show dose change tones 3 times in the show which did make the story a bit jarring.So I will be telling you about these part one at a time. So the story at the start  is pretty  much the episodic adventures of vash the stampede as he goes from town to town getting involved in random shenanigans even if  he wants to or not. This part of the story is pretty much used in order to establish  all the core characters that will be more important latter on. it also gives  reason to let a guard down so you won\\'t expect the more darker twists that lie ahead. The second part of trigun is pretty about exploreing the setting and how the world came to be and also some of  vash backstory with how he is connected to how This world came to be.Which is quite nice because your pretty much thrown into this sci-fi post apocalyptic western world with not much explained. It quite nice when a show try\\'s to get into some world building.  The third part is pretty much as dark and depressing the show will get.We have the main character being called to action again.With him now having to face his past There is good tension you can see the danger  lots of deathAnd Some decent amount of build up. Which pretty much will piss you off if you where really interested.because the conclusion Is very anti climatic.Characters, 7/10The main character is some what interesting.He is kind of two faced and not two faced as that he is a bad guy.  it\\'s more like the under his happy and goofy nature lies a darker side to him and you don\\'t really know what Side is the real one. But one down side to him is that his dual nature dose come off as a bit disjointed The side characters are all very interesting as well.They. Are all two dimensional in nature. But like the main character they are also two faced in a way. Which dose lead to some good character development and fleshing out.The villens in this show are also pretty fun and cool.Like for example you got a person who uses a saxophone as a weapon.And person that can use psychtic powers.Art, 7/10The animation is pretty gritty it kind of fits with the whole post apocalyptic setting.But on the bad Side the animation is very dated by today\\'s standards.It has a very retro style to it.It\\'s like a mix of late 90s  and old western moives.The character design are also very dated as well.Sound, 6/10The op is quite nice it really dose fit the tone of the show.The ost was also pretty good as well. It pretty much fit really well with very scene in the show.Th ost was done by tsuneo imahori. Who has also worked on the soundtrack for cowboy be bop.Enjoyment, 7/10So the thing I enjoyed about trigun would be quite a lot Of things. But guess I will mention a few.One of the things I quite like about trigun is the all the characters good or bad where quite fun and interesting.I also like the action scenes with all the gun fights.Overall, 7/10So overall trigun is pretty much a classic  90s show with good characters good story and pretty good ost as well. So pretty if your in to reto then you will love this show.But if your into the more modem anime then you will find trigun to be very dated by today\\'s standards which can really bring the show down a bit.ent10                              I have watched this show over 3 times and I fall in love with it every single time.  When I\\'m tired or having a bad day or just don\\'t know what to watch, I just grab some popcorn and put on any of the Trigun\\'s episodes and I end up forgetting about everything else. Trigun is what I believe to be a perfect anime and one of it\\'s key features to watch out for are the imagery, the play on words, the references to our society as in the different types of people. This series combines the action that kids love and the lesson                  that even adults need to learn.Story:There are 2 stories we are dealing, first is the main story of the anime and the second is the sub story of different episodes. The sub stories are brilliant, each one has a different moral and they slowly add to the main story bit by bit until it reaches the climax. I didn\\'t like the main story as much cause it was a bit slow though it did live up to it\\'s expectations. From a good laugh to a life and death situation to a question on society, Trigun manages to do it all.Art:Initially I was very reluctant to watch this show as it was animated in 1998 so I thought the  art and animation were gonna be terrible but boy I was wrong, from super powered robots to western gun fights, everything was beautiful.People say that \"you can tell a man by his shoes.\",well in anime its not the shoes but the hairstyles and Trigun\\'s quite an elaborate set of hairstyles. Almost all the characters had different hairstyles and clothes.Sound:I\\'ve seen this show dubbed and subbed and both have great voice actors and actresses. Great soundtracks and brilliant openings and endings.Overall:If you haven\\'t this show, you are missing out. If you have, I recommend you watch it again and look out for the imagery or google it. I am pretty sure you might have missed something. I mean the series did manage to get a movie 12 years after the series ended.Thank you,hk2                               Focused on the exploits of Vash the Stampede, Trigun is set on the Western-themed planet of Gunsmoke where Vash is a wanted outlaw for a number of mysterious destructive events taking place on the planet. Along for the ride are two insurance agents in the form of Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson who tag with Vash to try minimizing any damage he causes with the destructive activity he is supposedly responsible for.One thing to keep in mind with Trigun throughout its run is that first appearances can be deceiving. While Vash make seem like a comical goofball if you are coming upon this series for                  the first time, there is quite a bit more to his character than what you would see on the surface. Plus while the first half of the series starts off as a comedy-action title, hints are spread out throughout this part of the series that reveal more aspects to Vash\\'s character such as his superhuman gunmanship and idealist philosophy. Things gradually get more serious within the second half of the series where Vash\\'s past makes its presence felt on him as his origins get revealed and they are a rather complicated matter that push his idealist beliefs to their breaking point.For its time, Trigun was a rather unique title in its setting with mixing elements of sci-fi and westerns. While typical elements of westerns such as outlaw gangs, crooked sheriffs and survival in the desert are incorporated, the series also incorporates sci-fi elements such as robotic body parts for humans, the PLANTs that provide power to human cities and the unique origins of how human life came onto Gunsmoke. Vash\\'s origins play into this unique mixture when his origins are unveiled later in the series.While Vash is the main character of focus in Trigun, prominent characters within the series still get a decent amount of fleshing out. Meryl and Millie show a diverse range of personality when dealing with their adventures of Vash and Wolfwood gets a good deal of fleshing out having his own rather complicated origins and reasons to stick with Vash throughout later episodes in the series. The episodic plots even offer some fleshing out of major characters and introduce some rather colorful ones like members of the Nebraska family and Brilliant Dynamites Neon.The show does have some shortcomings. While the serious bent of Trigun\\'s second half helps to add an ongoing plot lacking from its first half, the enemy threat Vash and his allies confront suffer from some rather shallow development to a great extent since many of them only exist as obstacles to be put down and the true threat Vash confronts from his past makes little action throughout the series beyond a rather lackluster final battle in the series finale.Visually, Trigun is of standard quality for a late-90s anime series. There is a good amount of detail drawn into settings and character designs with subdued color toning. The highlights of the visuals come in the form of some of the technologies employed and some giant-sized enemy characters seen at points throughout the series. The series makes use of animation tricks to simulate fluid movement, particularly during heated battle scenes. However, the choreography for these scenes have their moments thanks to unique environments where they take place or the special abilities of foes that Vash confronts.The soundtrack of the series consists of western-influenced tracks consisting mostly of electronic rock and guitar numbers that are fitting for both the setting of the series and the mixture of action, comedy and drama found throughout its run.Overall, Trigun is a fun and engaging series that offered a original setting unique for its time, a nice balance of action-comedy and drama and a lovable and complicated lead character in the form of Vash. As one of anime\\'s popular gateway drug titles, this is an easy recommendation to make as the series is very accessible to non-anime fans, especially with the excellent English dub featuring Johnny Yong Bosch as Vash.        nt10                              Trigun (1998) is a classic, albeit with a few marginal flaws that can be overlooked (easily, mind you), but after a while can be annoying in the course of the story.These marginal flaws are the reason why I gave it a low score in art (6/10). When I had first seen this anime, I assumed it to be in the 80s (any time before the Akira movie was release). But when I read that it was released in 1998, I felt disappointed. The art style could have been a little more smoother (especially when we must bear in mind that the late 90s gave us                  Ghost in the Shell (1998), as well as Princess Mononoke (1998), The Big O (1997/1998/1999), and prior to the 90s we had Akira (1988), Grave of the Fireflies (1989), as well as the Evangelion series. I will be frank that although it did not hinder me from enjoying this classic, it did disappoint me to realize that the art style was not given that much attention as it should be.Which is why Trigun earned a perfect score in everything else. Lets just take into consideration the names alone: Vash the Stampede is the protagonist and Millions Knives (that\\'s his manga name, although he is only known as Knives in the anime) is the antagonist. In between we have Monev the Gale, Rai-Dei the Blade, Gray the Ninelives, Caine the Longshot, Legato Bluesummers. I\\'m just putting in the names here, but lets be honest - Trigun has the best names I\\'ve found amongst the anime I\\'ve seen thus far. And their stories do match their personalities quite well.At the same time, the environments are really immersive, and the subtle moments which do sink in, are worth their while. These subtle moments, combined with the humorous antics of the characters (Vash in particular) do help in making the ending less... distraught than it might have been when we compare the general tendencies of anime.On the whole, its a classic. Its worth watching for its story, and its worth watching the gunmen (particularly Nicholas D. Wolfwood) in this series. You won\\'t be disappointed - I know I wasn\\'t.        9                              Overview:Ask any Western anime fan what anime you should watch. Chances are, one of the titles they\\'ll mention is \"Trigun\". While practically unheard of in its native country of Japan, \"Trigun\" is ridiculously popular in America and other Western-speaking countries, and for good reason. While I don\\'t consider it to be the masterpiece some people consider it, I can say that if you\\'re looking for a space-western flick, \"Trigun\" will more than suffice.Story & World (10/10):\"Trigun\" is set on the planet Gunsmoke, a desert world that humans populated over 100 years ago and is filled to the brim with mechanically-modified outlaws. The most dreaded outlaw                  is Vash the Stampede, who has a whopping $$60,000,000 bounty on his head. Two agents, Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson are tracking Vash in order to bring an end to the destruction that surrounds him. The twist? Vash isn\\'t really a heartless killer. In fact, he\\'s the opposite. He\\'s a hero who absolutely hates death, to the point that he refuses to kill anyone no matter what and most of the damage caused is really done by bounty hunters who are after him.The story starts off episodic but gradually develops into something much bigger. What makes the story so brilliant is that Vash\\'s morality constantly comes into question. This is a world where it\\'s pretty much kill or be killed so Vash\\'s pacifism is often questioned by allies and enemies alike, who believe he couldn\\'t have survived what he has without at least killing someone. The message of this is that, while killing is wrong, it is unfortunately also necessary sometimes, something Vash learns the hard way over the course of the series.The story has a fantastic pace and never stays in the same place for too long. Even the recap episode is quite good as it highlights a number of things you yourself may have missed the first time. Add in a brilliant backstory for the world and a great ending and you have yourself a truly amazing story.Art and Animation (6.5/10):The series first aired in 1998, and boy does it show! While it may have looked good back in the day, the passage of time has not been kind. It does look pretty good for the most part but there are occasions when you really see just how badly its aged. There are times when people in the background are nothing more than walking outlines and some really stereotypical parts such as when Vash\\'s finger gets hurt and swells and turns red. All in all, the low point of the series by miles.Sound & Dialogue (9/10):The soundtrack isn\\'t exactly noteworthy and for the most part is just guitar themes that tend to blend into the background. However, a lot of scenes don\\'t really need music as the sound effects do the job really well. The voice acting, on the other hand, is fantastic, with Johnny Yong Bosch stealing the show as Vash. The dialogue is equally good, doing a great job at getting the points of the various characters across without ever descending into melodrama. Simple, but effective is the key here, though I won\\'t go into that. It\\'s best if you just see it for yourself.Characters (8.5/10):The show has four main protagonists in total. Two of them are the aforementioned Meryl and Milly, who are pretty normal but still more than capable of holding their own. Meryl, in particular, doesn\\'t wait around for Vash to save her and at one point frees herself with both hands tied behind her back. No, literally. She also has dozens of pistols hidden under her coat and is an excellent shot, though she rarely gets a chance to use them and doesn\\'t really cause any damage. Not that she tries to.A while into the series, we also meet Nicholas D. Wolfwood, a priest and also a gunman who carries around a massive cross-shaped gun and acts as Vash\\'s foil throughout the series. Like Vash, he is a superb guman, but unlike him, he is very quick to kill, having raised to be an assassin as well as a priest. He hardly ever feels any remorse for killing, especially when it\\'s to protect the innocent. He and Vash have some minor disagreements on this matter, which is somewhat ironic due to their occupations as gunfighters. Unfortunately, his screen-time is quite limited compared to the others.The characters are all very good in their own rights but, ultimately, Vash trumps them all. Throughout the first four episodes, he doesn\\'t fire his gun even once, but still manages to defuse several extremely dangerous situations. When he does fire his gun, he single-handedly disarms a giant cyborg and saves a group of people that said cyborg was trying to kill. He\\'s not just a powerhouse, though. It becomes clear later that he\\'s far from the cheerful idiot he presents himself as, and that he\\'s really a deeply traumatized person with a borderline split personality. He really is a very interesting, multi-layered character.The villains are quite good as well, though I can\\'t say anything about them without giving some spoilers. Let\\'s just say that they really try hard to break Vash away from his pacifistic beliefs.Enjoyment (9/10):\"Trigun\" is in absolutely no short supply of thrills. Almost every episode features at least one great action scene and the final fight is definitely one to remember. Ultimately, though, there were only a few that really stood in my mind.Overall:\"Trigun\" is one of the best \\'90s anime out there that still manages to hold up even to this day, with an incredible story about morality and more action than a Bruce Willis film. There are a few things that keep it from sheer brilliance, but Vash and his story will do nothing if not entertain you.        ent10                              Trigun is one of those animes that goes beyond expectations.  After watching One Piece and Rurouni Kenshin, I thought I was well acquainted with the typical \\'protagonist who doesn\\'t kill\\', but no character has MASTERED this persona like Vash.There is a back-and-forth between serious and comical that I find has been perfected in this anime.  I was initially under the impression that this was an anime in which no violence or mature content would be shown in any form, and I was under that impression for a LONG time--about half-way through--and then it got deliciously dark...  like 85% dark chocolate dark.... mmmmThe                  main character, Vash, is such a mix of characteristics.  Once all sides of him are shown, he is easily one of the most interesting anime characters you will undoubtedly make a connection with.The \\'badass hero moments\\' were also perfected.  SO MANY animes ruin their own hero moments by drawing it with long scenes of dialogue or still frame pictures with nothing happening but noises.  Thankfully, Trigun does not do that.  Trigun is an absolute timeless anime.                                      Trigun is interesting and quirky to say the least. It stars Vash (aka Vash The Stampede), a goof ball, sensitive, nurturing guy with a weird obsessive love for donuts and life. This pacifist hates using his gun but rather uses his voice to try to talk (but more often run) out of dangerous situations he is always caught up in! his mantra is \"every life is special and no one has the right to take away someone\\'s life and future\" STORY: 8/10 it was interesting. this anime definitely paved the way for more psychological animes. what was nice about the story here is that while                  it still has very thought provoking tones in it, its shown to the viewer in a light hearted and almost childish way, which might turn off some people, verses shows like \"Psycho-pass\" or \"Monster\" which take a very dark approach to the meaning of life, and who/what should dictate who should live or die. ART: 7/10 well all i can say is you get what you pay for. this anime was made in the 90s, so 90s quality is what you are going to get. its smooth /most/ of the time. there are some points where the frame rate will drop a little, the lines arent really that clear (especially in the first couple of episodes). but it isnt too much of a problem where its so distracting that its totally un-watchable      SOUND: 7/10 the sound effect (which is one of the most important things considering it takes place in a sort of futuristic western period) was pretty on point. you had the rustling of clothes and metal when characters were walking and the loading of guns and guns shots and all that fun stuff. the music was decent. nothing too memorable except for Rem\\'s theme which is a motif played tons of times during the series. it was very touching because they successfully associated the song with a character with such a kind disposition even tough we didnt see much of her. the style of the rest of the music is like western/rock/jazz (?) it wasnt too bad but i preferred some tracks over othersCHARACTERS: 8/10 Milly and Meryl were really great supporting characters!! in the beginning i thought they were rather useless to the story because there job is literally to just follow Vash around and record all of the damage done by him to send to the insurance company they both work at, but they end up being quite vital towards the end and i think the romance Meryl and Vash, which never really is officalized in the anime, is really cute. Nicholas Wolfwood and Milly might be the two complex characters in the anime because of what they present compared too what their thought process is. Wolfwood\\'s story really takes everyone by storm because imo, i thought he was going to be another bad guy Vash had to fight but its so much more complex than that. The backstory for Wolfwood was small but i think it was exactly what was needed to send the kind of message they did about him. Milly also took me by surprise because we know basically nothing about her and she is basically the airhead of the group but actually how she processes what is happening to her and the people around her is really deep and meaningful and you should never know unless someone told you. it\\'s more surprising because we know nothing about her backstory other than the fact that she is the youngest of 6 children so i guess it is all up to interpretation of how Milly crafted her thinking.OVERALL AND ENJOYMENT: 8/10 the beginning is kinda slow because it comes off as episodic while they are trying to introduce all of the characters, but once you get past that its a really good anime. The ending is refreshing, it had its moments where it really pulled on my heart strings, and it evened the serious stuff out with its fair share of dopey moments!! although i wouldnt venture to say that the characters were relatable, the messages and philosophical/psychological ideas might be. I know that i personally can connect to Vash\\'s message of pacifism and valuing all life so i guess that\\'s the anime\\'s way of bringing the viewer into the experience                                         Trigun. One of the great anime of the 90\\'s, or that\\'s what I was told before I started watching this anime. People told me that I should think of it as another Cowboy Bebop so I came in to watch it with very, very high expectations. Which if you don\\'t already know is a big mistake because most of the time you\\'ll end up disappointed... like I was. But without it being put beside Bebop it\\'s a very good anime in its own merits. Oh and this anime I recommend to watch it in Dub which is something I won\\'t very often do but the                  voice actors for the dub pull it off so well better so than the voice actors in the sub who weren\\'t bad by any means but not as good as the dub. Story (8/10) Very GoodThe story of Trigun itself I was very pleased with, in particular the second half of it which did an actual arc and had a lot darker tone to the happy comedic first half which it had. In saying that the second half still had comedic moments but the darker element of the second half outweighed the comedy.The first half didn\\'t really have any real arc, the longest an individual story lasted for was 2 episodes and that only happened once during the sand steamer bit. The rest are just episodic stories some of them having no meaning to the overall story *cough* Episode 2 *cough* but in some cases the episodic stories did have meaning and help the viewer understand the mystery which is Vash the Stampede (Main Protagonist).  But in end the meaningless episodic stories brought down my liking of Trigun\\'s story which I thought was the best part of the anime. Art/Animation (8/10) Very Good (For its time)Now yes the art style and animation in this isn\\'t anything amazing but it\\'s far from bad. This is the late 90s animation back then isn\\'t anywhere as good as it is today. And with that being said for a late 90s anime it\\'s a bit better looking than the majority of other things that came out during it\\'s time. The character design and weapon designs where in a league of its own for its time.Sound (6/10) Fair Now other than the Opening OST the sound for this anime is average and I really, really didn\\'t enjoy the Ending OST, reason I simply just really, really didn\\'t like it. Gun shots sound average. The sound effects I found to be bland and repetitive and by that I mean a slap, punch and a kick should all have different sound effects not all the same. And same goes for the gun sound effects Vash who has a very different gun to everyone else should have had its own sound effect but everything was the same. That being the thing that annoyed me the most about the anime. The voice acting was well above average (Dub) I would have rated it more highly but the voice of Milly in particular really didn\\'t sit with me well other than that though the dub voices were really good and average (Sub) which is why I highly recommend watching it Dub not Sub. Characters (7/10) GoodThe characters I didn\\'t love as a whole but aspects of them I really enjoyed. For Vash I loved his serious side which came out really only when peoples lives were involved and that serious side of him made him a total badass. Then how quickly he could change tones I didn\\'t really like that much and his happy-go-lucky tone at times just pissed me off with his character. Meryl and Milly were your typical brain and brawns duo with Meryl also playing the role of Vash\\'s tsundere, by this me saying their characters weren\\'t anything special just average. Wolfwood on the other hand was my favourite character in the entire anime. Similar to Vash he could be comedic but also had a serious side as well. Wolfwood showing his serious side a lot more often than Vash though making him a lot more of a badass. Wolfwood being the character who solely brought my rating for this category from a 5 or a 6 to a solid 7.Enjoyment (7/10) GoodI enjoyed this anime not to what I could have because of my expectations I had for before watching it. And the first 5 episodes having no real meaning to the end game of the story made me loose a lot of enjoyment for this anime. But the second half of the anime onwards so from the episode titled Diablo it gets much better and much more enjoyable. Overall (7/10) *(7.2/10)         9                              I’d recommend Trigun to fans of Sci-Fi, Adventure, Action and Comedy everywhere, as it simply distils the best of all of these genres, and makes it accessible to everyone. So far, it\\'s one of the best series I\\'ve seen, simply because it\\'s just such fun to watch. There are several reasons for this: the main reason is the sound and the style. Cowboy Bebop was among the first series I watched, and Trigun shares many of the characteristics that made Cowboy Bebop so great. Here, various stereotypical Western themes are used and the music keeps the series going, adding the necessary emotion to every scene.          Moreover, let me just say, Trigun has the best openings I have ever seen. The gargantuan guitar riff driving the OP would leave you to believe the series is just filled with action-packed gunfights, with an incredibly cool protagonist.In this respect, Trigun is deceptive. Vash the Stampede is a cool character, yet for nearly every awesome action he performs, there\\'s an equally ridiculous and idiotic gesticulation to counter it. While it certainly creates a memorable protagonist, it can lead to some frustration as it means his personality can never be pinned down and defined, due to this constant subversion. I do not mind this one bit. The first half of the series is mainly a series of comedic adventures, which suddenly turns into an altogether different beast halfway through the series. The darker theme that explains the series’ main story arc still contains comedic moments, but these are dropped in favour of narrative, and the ability that Trigun has, to juggle comedy with bleakness, is outstanding. However, the main draw of the series is undeniably Vash, and if you do not find yourself entertained by such an incredible character as his, it is doubtful you will enjoy the series. Fortunately, it is nigh on impossible not to appreciate such a likeable character as his, which makes such an amusing and entertaining series.         nt10                              Despite how iconic this show is compared to other animes its surrounded by, I feel like this show is extremely underrated if not unreasonably passed over by anime fans because of the outdated art style.The show follows a care-free gunslinger who, for some mysterious reason, is constantly being chased around under the premise of the bounty on his head; despite the fact that he is a pacifist and wouldn\\'t dare hurt a fly!You are grabbed from the first episode and are never let go as the mystery behind this world and this character get more fleshed out with each episode.Please watch this ASAP. I give                  it a definite green light!                                      Summary: This one is fairly unique. It has that old animation style you\\'ll find in classics such as Dragonball. What\\'s interesting is the women who plays Merly also plays Bulma in Dragonball, so that is kind of neat. What I find absolutely fascinating about this anime is how much it ramps up from Episode 1 to 26. It starts as a lighthearted and silly show... little do you know it is building up to be something intense that you would never see coming. The backstory of Vash, Knives and the other characters is way out in left field and at the end I found myself                  wondering how what started as a silly gun shooting western turned into Trigun. You will laugh, you will probably cry, and you will fall in love with these characters without even realizing it. All said, this is probably a must watch for people who want a deep philosophical and character driven story; that is it you can tolerate the older animation style and get through the fluffy beginning into the truly deep and epic story to come. Vash is a truly noble and unique character, one you likely won\\'t encounter many times and who is worth spending 2 seasons with!Rating: Story 9 / Art 7 / Sound 8 / Character 9 / Enjoyment 7/ Overall 8                                      *This is an archive from my Anime-Planet account*Critic\\'s Log - Earthdate: December 28, 2012. Review #28: TrigunLife is a journey, I think most people would agree on that. There are endless possibilities on whatever path a person chooses to walk in. Some paths may be filled with light, love, and happiness while some other paths may be filled with darkness, hatred, and despair. I chose to walk to a path where I live an extraordinary life. There will always be challenges in life and we eventually have to overcome these challenges and we have to confront our destiny whether we can control it or not.                  Some people try to find the meaning of life but I do believe that life has multiple meanings.With that said, I shall set the philosophical stuff aside and do a review like I always do. Let\\'s stampede on this gun-toting classic and gunslinging ride that which is Trigun!Vash the Stampede is a outlaw gunslinger on the run with a $$60 billion bounty on his head which has made it hard for him to go anywhere without being chased and shot at. Every town he ever visits ends up being destroyed because of his pursuers, but miraculously no one ever gets killed. Meryl and Milly are agents for the Bernardelli Insurance Society that have been sent to find Vash the Stampede and keep him under surveillance so no more damage is caused. Meryl, who leads the pair, refuses to believe that the man they have met can possibly be The Humanoid Typhoon that they are looking for. This spiky haired, gangly, young man is extremely friendly, a pacifist, hates blood and suicide, absolutely loves donuts, he is also silly and a crybaby (far from a notorious outlaw). But there is more to Vash and his past than meets the eye.To be technical, this is a Studio Madhouse production and Madhouse is known for their great quality in animation. Trigun however does have some nice cool looking animation from time to time, but most of the time it\\'s a bit hit and miss. Some of the earlier episodes didn\\'t look impressive on some parts. Luckily, the first episode didn\\'t have much problems with animation quality. Also, This anime came out in the same year that Cowboy Bebop did and that anime had great quality in animation for its time and Sunrise isn\\'t a studio known for top-notch quality animation like Studio Madhouse tends to get an acclaimed reception for. Maybe Trigun didn\\'t have the budget like Cowboy Bebop did, who knows. Honestly, I have no problem with the animation. I know it\\'s hit and miss in some areas, but it\\'s not too disappointing when it comes to the action scenes which I do think that Trigun has some awesome gun fights. All in all... The animation isn\\'t terrible by any means, it\\'s mostly good but not as top-notch as you would expect from Madhouse, it\\'s just sometimes off in some areas.What makes the show great are the characters, they are the heart of the show and they are pretty unforgettable. Vash the Stampede is hands down one of the most memorable heroes in anime because of his somewhat bizarre appearance as well has his mysterious personality. He doesn\\'t carry the story alone. There\\'s Nicholas D. Wolfwood, a priest that is fascinating to watch with his reflection on Vash\\'s nature and an intense opposition of Vash\\'s way of life. Meryl Strife and Milly Thompson are also fun to watch, even though Meryl is short-tempered, she is compassionate toward others. She\\'s a nice character. Then there\\'s her co-worker Milly Thompson who happens to be very muscular which she physically towers over Meryl. She\\'s a character that looks up to Meryl and she appears to be rather simple yet she shows genuine optimism as well as a kind heart. I like her too. The minor characters as well as some characters that only appear in one episode as well do handle the greater part of this little deceptive bugger. I\\'ll explain more of that later. Who else is left? Oh! How can I forget about the sadist with the malicious use of his psychic powers?. That\\'s right, I\\'m referring to Legato Bluesummers. He is by far one of the most memorable villians in an anime and even though he\\'s not the main villian, he was still fascinating to watch from his first appearance to the last. Then there\\'s Knives Millions which has got to be the strangest name for a fictional character. In fact, some of the names in this series are a bit weird. I\\'ll give some credit to Yasuhiro Nightow, it is a pretty unique and original method for naming characters. Anyway, Knives Millions has a immense hatred toward humanity and he doesn\\'t really appear all too much until the end. Knives was a bit interesting at times. The characters really make the show memorable. Also, keep an eye out for a black cat in any episode of the show because this black cat appears in a brief scene in every episode of the show, maybe just for sight gags.The music is done by Tsuneo Imahori and he happened to be the guitarist for The Seatbelts (the band that was formed by Yoko Kanno for the soundtrack of Cowboy Bebop). The soundtrack for Trigun is a bit under-appreciated except for the awesome kickass opening, and the catchy closing theme. The music does bring life to the world of Trigun (A desert planet named Gunsmoke if I\\'m not mistaken) and the soundtrack is nice to hear from time to time. Even Legato\\'s theme is a little eerie. The music is pretty good on its own.When it comes to the voice performances. The Subbed version is pretty good for the most part, but I do find Trigun rewarding while watching it Dubbed. There are times where I do prefer the English voice over the other. Some characters were performed well on both sides as well. Masaya Onosaka is great as Vash but there are times where he overacts a little bit, not too bad. Johnny Yong Bosch on the other hand was terrific as Vash The Stampede and this was his debut anime role and he sure had more than amateur\\'s luck at the time. Sho Hayami is pretty good for the most part as Nicholas D. Wolfwood, but Jeff Nimoy really gives Wolfwood a voice of likability. Hiromi Tsuru was okay as Meryl while Dorothy Elias-Fahn sounds just right as Meryl. Satsuki Yukino is great as Milly as well as Lia Sargent. Aya Hisakawa is also great as Rem, same goes for Bridget Hoffman. Tohru Furusawa and Bo Williams are both alright as Knives. Toshihiko Seki and Richard Cansino are both terrific as Legato. There are some worthy seiyus to mention that were pretty good in Trigun. Unsho Ishizuka was great as Brilliant Dynamites Neon. Akio Ohtsuka voiced one of the Gung-ho Guns, Rai-Dei the Blade. Atsuko Tanaka voices Claire, and Norio Wakamoto voiced Gofsef. As far as worthy Voice actors to mention, Joshua Seth was terrific as the younger Knives. Mona Marshall voices Kaite, Kirk Thornton voices Rai-Dei The Blade, and Steve Blum voices Professor Nebraska, Mr. Blum was a bit over the top on this one compared to his other roles. I guess in a way you can\\'t go wrong with either version and even though the dub isn\\'t really an all-star dub, it still is a very likable dub and I really like the dub to Trigun.I mentioned earlier that Trigun is a little deceptive bugger, well I wasn\\'t kidding when I said this because this show starts off as a wild west comedy with some over the top action scenes and it gave Trigun the popcorn entertainment treatment, or so we think. As the show gets right to the middle, we delve into Vash\\'s past which is pretty sad and surprisingly thought-provoking as well. As the series nears its end, it jumps from being a comedy and spirals downward to a drama. Episodes 23 and 24 are undeniably the most cruel episodes in the show. One particular episode ends on a sad note while the next one has a nerve-shattering moment that I guarantee will send chills down your spine if you\\'re emotionally invested in the characters. However, is the transition from comedy to drama a bad thing for Trigun? Honestly, in Trigun\\'s case... No! When Trigun comes in full circle, it is saved by the depth of humanity of the cast of characters. Remember Neon Genesis Evangelion? 2/3 of the show was more on action while that last third was all philosophical and psycologically complex and not many viewers complained about the change of direction. Trigun does the same thing except with comedy then drama.  Vash\\'s philosophy of non-violence is charming to begin with and easy to cheer on about, but once it\\'s put into a cruel context, Vash has to wonder if it\\'s killing more people than it saves and struggles far more against himself than Legato which makes for a surprisingly emotional moment as well as a deep one as well. When it all comes down to story, Trigun is mainly episodic and there is no line of blatant exposition at all, which makes a somewhat interesting experience from the storytelling. However, there are some questions that aren\\'t answered in the anime and I\\'ve been told that there are questions answered in the manga. To be honest, interpretation is nice to think about because it makes a good conversation regarding a certain topic in a show. There\\'s really not much room for interpretation if you decide to read the manga alongside the anime, but as the show on its own, whatever questions that have not been answered is all up to your imagination. What really works for the story of Trigun is the believability of the characters, its originality in characters, settings and even character designs even if some character designs do look a bit bizarre. I also like the symbolism in Trigun. Vash\\'s red coat is a pretty significant symbol to the story. I thought it was there for show Rem  said something about red geraniums (a type of flower if you don\\'t know) in the flashback episode. A highly notable use of symbolism in Trigun is references to Christianity. Religious or not, the usage of this symbolism really doesn\\'t throw it at your face and shove it down your throat, it gives Trigun a nice touch. The reasoning behind the Christian imagery in the show is because Yasuhiro Nightow (the creator of Trigun) is a Christian (Roman Catholic from what I\\'ve looked up). That\\'s what works. What doesn\\'t work in the show is the show\\'s pacing near the end as well as the ending. The pacing of the show was pretty average for 20 some episodes until it starts getting pretty dark, that\\'s when the show starts wrapping up in a rushed pace. I do think there were a couple of moments where the music does not fit in certain scenes but that\\'s a minor nitpick. However, the last episode could have had better direction because I did like how they were showing Vash\\'s past in full circle, but the first half of the final episode mostly shows that and then most of the second half shows the big showdown between Vash and Knives and the fight itself was pretty cool and well... After that, the show ends two minutes later. I felt the show\\'s ending was a bit rushed. It\\'s not really a terrible ending to say the least. I just thought the final episode could have had better direction. This shouldn\\'t really stop me or anyone else from enjoying Trigun because there are some things to like about Trigun. It is an anime classic that still gets mentioned today.Trigun was available from Geneon until they went under. It is available from Funimation after they rescued it a few years back. The manga by Yasuhiro Nightow is available from Dark Horse. The Trigun movie \"Badlands Rumble\" is available from Funimation. A video game called \"Trigun: The Planet Gunsmoke\" was in the works by Red Entertainment and SEGA has not made any recent comments about it and is believed to be cancelled.With all that said, Trigun is a gun-toting anime classic that does have hit-and miss animation but it has effective secretive storytelling since the story is moving at times, the music compliments the show and its settings, and the characters are believable in their own ways. I do think the cool appeal is very high in this show. It isn\\'t perfect, but it still remains an anime classic to this day.I give Trigun a 9 out of 10. It is EXCELLENT!Feel free to leave a comment, and repeat after me...THIS WORLD IS MADE OF... LOVE AND PEACE!                                       Check out that animation when Vash fights that samurai guy. HA HA HA HA! Budget issues much? First some good things. The environment feels very fleshed out and realized. You could sum it up perfectly with \"sci-fi plus western,\" but it feels like its own world, which I really feel is a huge boon in fiction.Flaws, though? Inconsistent, often very poor animation. Two one-dimensional characters crammed together (an idiot savant joker and a dark, troubled guy) instead of a truly fleshed out protagonist. A sudden tone swing in the middle of the series from comedy to drama that is very, very ham-fistedly \"dark\". (It\\'s really                  sad and stuff when a kid dies, innit?!)It seems like their heart was in the right place, but I imagine adult swim nostalgia is about the best thing Trigun has to offer anyone nowadays.        t10                              “I\\'ve never seen anyone kick so much ass in my entire life.” - CivilianTrigun is a little known anime with large potentialStory: The Story progresses along quite smoothly and offers some good suspense with the unpredictability of Vash the Stampede. It’s normally comedic and action packed but touch on serious subjects and hard thought moral dilemmas. It gradually earns some very heartfelt moments and some insane twists. Characters: Many of the characters are well written especially Vash and The main Villain.  Vash the Stampede is known to be baddest dude in the West, Having a 6 billion dollar bounty on his head. We than                  learn to find out his bounty is gained from a strain of misunderstandings and people stealing his name. He believes strongly in peace and tries not to kill. He is quite the skirt chaser in many situations. He is a very goofy character but does tense up and become incredibly serious.Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson are two agents of the Insurance Company looking to evaluate cases regarding Vash. Meryl is a more serious character being very independent, and short-tempered. On the other hand Milly is incredibly tall, appearing simple she has a very kind heart and a rather optimistic outlook upon lifeArt: The character designs are basic with side characters but Villains and Main characters have incredibly odd but interesting designs. The desert and outpost towns look have a rustic and unique look to them.The voice acting is swell in Japanese and just as well in English. It does have so great weapon sound effects.Overall this is a very well made show escalating to have a small following. It is well worth the watch.                              I tried so hard to enjoy this anime.  Trigun is supposed to be a classic.  Its supposed to be on all anime fans\\' must watch list.  I tried so hard to like it, and i watched to episode 18.  After that i couldn\\'t take it anymore and had to drop it.  The episodic nature of the show for the first half is very painful to get through.   There are no important story beats anywhere in these episodes.  In the second half there are flashes of some promise.  Especially in the episode that flashes back to when                  Vash was a child.  I though that this was where the series turned around! (even though ive watched more than half of it at this point)  But sadly, it went back to pointless episodic stories, which are so boring.  If someone could explain to me why this series is so acclaimed, maybe i would try to pick it up and finish it.  As of right now, i cant see myself returning to this series, and i really wanted to like this show.        t10                              Trigun é sem dúvidas o meu anime favorito, acompanhar a história desses personagens incríveis foi sensacional. Os personagens e história são incríveis, a trilha sonora é ótima, e somente não ganhou um 10, por sua animação que infelizmente é muito datada. Existe também o filme, que é mais recente e possui uma animação muito superior, porém não é um bom filme. Meu sonho é um Remake de Trigun com a animação do filme. Se isso acontecesse o anime simplesmente não teria erro. A filosofia que o anime apresenta é talvez das melhores que já vi em um anime. Trigun por mim é um dos animes                  que você DEVE ver. Recomendo a todos e por mim é um dos melhores animes já feitos.        8                                                                    \"An excellent anime series\"In a nutshell, Trigun follows the heroic if goofy gunman Vash in his adventures on a distant planet with a distinctly Western motif. Vash, it seems, is not too popular and finds himself in constant danger.Evading bounty hunters and old enemies, his past is slowly revealed. Though a strict pacifist, Vash has superhuman speed and skill that aid him in battle due to the                  fact that he is a member of a mysterious race of quasi-angelic beings referred to only as Plants.The pacifistic Vash has an arch-nemesis, however, his brother Knives, who has no problem with violence. It seems the humans exploit the Plants and Knives sees it as his duty to wipe out humanity as the only sure way of stopping them. Assembling an army of villains lead by Legato Bluesummers, he intends to make Vash pay for his compassion for humanity. Along the way, the ideals of peace are tested against the reality of conflict and even the immense skill of Vash cannot protect him from the grim choice to kill in order to prevent worse.Despite its initial appearances, Trigun has a great plot, memorable characters, and surprisingly good music. As with many anime series, though, the first half is pretty slow and full of some silly stuff. Though not especially groundbreaking, it is well worth the time of any fan of anime.        t10                              This is first time I watched the entire series and the fact it’s been on Adult Swim around 2003, I had gone 9 years (or 14 years if you count when it was released in Japan) without seeing the series as a whole. From what I know from the show, it is a Space Western Adventure series (kind of like the vein of another anime series with that theme and presence) and yet, it didn’t garnered much of an audience in Japan but it did accomplish that goal in America, considering the themes and surroundings of the show have something that is more related to                  western society.Anyway, the plot is centered on a very lighthearted, expert marksman named Vash the Stampede or “The Humanoid Typhoon” (because I really don’t believe that this is his real name: Valentinez Alkalinella Xifax Sicidabohertz Gumbigobilla Blue Stradivari Talentrent Pierre Andres Charton-Haymoss Ivanovicci Baldeus George Doitzel Kaiser III  -  try saying that three times in a row), who is a very known outlaw for causing damage whenever he appears and because of that, bounty hunters are hunting and chasing him for the pursuit of  “60,000,000,000 $$” (sixty-billion double dollars)”. Yeah, if you had a bounty like that on your head, you’ll be dead within a heartbeat and to think what will you do with money like that, I could either rule the world with an iron fist, having legions of armies surrounding me, have harems all day every day and…….wait, what was I talking about again? Oh yeah, Trigun. Then there are the two insurance employees from the Bernardelli Insurance Society named Meryl Strife & Milly Thompson. Meryl is the strong-willed yet hotheaded one of the duo and finds Vash to be more of a nuisance than what most people already preceded as him. She soon begins to have some romantic feelings toward him but it was never determined in the series. Milly is the kind-hearted and genuinely optimistic one in the duo.  She always looks up to Meryl and that’s despite her physically towering over her. Did I mention that Meryl hides her many derringer-style pistols under her coat and Milly carries and hides a heavy concussion gun under her coat?There’s also Nicholas D. Wolfwood aka Nicolas the Punisher, taken in by a Chapel and modifies him with as an successor and also carries a special large cross-shaped gun called The Punisher, containing two machine guns and a rocket launcher. The main antagonist in the series is Millions Knives (what the hell kind of name is that? It sounds worse than Jacuzzi Splot.) And he is Vash’s twin brother and he has a superiority complex of how humans are inferior creatures, has no value of life for others and only believes in survival of the fittest and always seeks to dissuade Vash basing his life around the idealistic way taught by Rem Saverem, a SEEDS ship crew member who instills the philosophy of how every being deserves life.Now on the serious tip, that philosophy that I just mentioned does have good tensions surrounding around it but it have some shaky flaws towards it. Vash doesn’t want to end an being life but most of the times, the being that he let go ends up hurting and killing innocent ones that never deserves it and the ones that have no remorse, no regrets toward anyone but themselves does not deserve a second chance, especially some of the villains in the show, including Knives and yes, even though Knives is a villain and I’m supposed to hate him, I immediately want that guy to be killed off and wanted him to have an bullet enter his cranial. Vash does have good intentions and a little more humanistic but the ideals he was brought up are not always up to perfection and very flawed.Now as for the animation and since it was made in 1998, it looks really dated as for now but Madhouse did made some good animation at that time period and I think it does get either better or slightly worse into the show. The opening music and the ending theme music are a fantastic feat done by Tsuneo Imahori and of course, Akima & Neos. So, in short, I really love the music in the series.FINAL VERDICT:  Despite that flawed philosophy ramble I made, this is an enjoyable series that I would consider to be a favorite. The characters are mostly humanistic (well, the main characters are) and likable; it doesn’t skimp on the character development that much and spread it on some of the characters, although there is little development on the girls but it wasn’t much of a problem. Would I recommend this to anyone? Yes, I would.9                              When you think of red geranium flowers, does the word \"determined\" come to mind, no? Me neither. But this is one of the many quotes from Trigun that can lead you to ask yourself thought provoking questions such as \"can murder ever be justified?\" or \"why does a black cat keep popping up on screen?\"Trigun is a late 90\\'s Western styled anime documenting the life of the fugitive, anti hero/hero humanoid typhoon Vash the stampede. It follows his life story as well as those caught up in his life, Milly Thompson and Maryl Strife from an insurance society and Wolfword a\"so-called\" priest who travel around                  always meeting Vash one way or another.When it comes to Triguns story, we see a multitude of noticeable traits of more predictable shows. It starts off as a mere character focused (in this case Vash) episodic plot line, with a slow and almost care-free sort of pacing. A few jokes, sometimes cheesy is thrown in and all stirred together with a splash of action. But when it hits the end of the first cour, the plot really does start to thicken. Many themes such as passivism, the right to kill and religion all start to blend together nicely to create a more though provoking anime. It does make you question motives of those who kill, and if in any way killing can be justified. Furthermore, it shows how important friends can be to those who are facing troubles. With this perfect blend of comedy, action, suspense and real life questions, it truly does become a well written spectacle to watch. Lastly, the ending provided a satisfying answer to the characters many problems, and in all was thoroughly enjoyable.The back story is filled in with cut away scenes towards the middle of the second cour. It can be seen that Vash\\'s true identity wasn\\'t explained well enough, and could be seen as very puzzling. Furthermore, the slow pacing at the start could be misconstrued as bad writing. However, the slow start further adds to the drama and surprise as how the story develops.When it comes to the animation, it unfortunately lags behind many anime\\'s of today. It was made in 98, but even other anime\\'s in the late 90\\'s showed more quality than Trigun. Furthermore, the character models are very easy to remember as they aren\\'t particularly unique. This is because they are recycled from anime\\'s made around the same time. Therefore, the animation is definitely not rememberable.The characters however are another kettle of fish. Vash himself is what makes this anime so good. His laughable antics, amazing skills in combat and boyish charm can make him easily likeable. But the character development digs deeper and beyond that. It shows a more sensitive, pacifist side, contradictory to his fugitive title and living in a western styled environment. His relationship with Wolfword created a \"ying and yang\" complex, which further demonstrated the great writing of two different characters.However, Milly Thompson and Maryl Strife, although occurred very frequently, were those whom didn\\'t gain much character development. In spite of this, both managed to add some humor and undertones of romance to the series, as well as defending Vash in spite of his tarnished name.Musically, the score in itself has ups and downs. The opening and ending both are easily forgettable, as both add nothing musically that will take anyone a gasp with joy. Both the opening and ending songs are mainly to fulfill Vash\\'s true persona. However, the OST is something to be proud of. The music can sometimes help amplify action, as well as some tunes weaved into character development.To conclude, I still don\\'t believe red geraniums signify determined. It does for Vash however. In all, this anime is a real hidden gem from the late 90\\'s which can be enjoyable for anyone. I do recommend this as being a brilliantly thought out show.10                              Trigun is an anime that I really didn\\'t expect it to enjoy. It looked fun, but the character Vash was a a wimp and I quickly lost interest. A friend gave the the complete series on DVD, begging me to watch the whole series and sadly, I did. I saw down and watched the series and I have to admit it\\'s pretty damn awesome. It\\'s now my favorite to watch all day and it\\'s also one hell of an insane show, mixing western with technology where a planet is dying and the human race are forced to live in it.I\\'m not gonna tell the whole                  plot, cause most of you all know what Trigun is about, but for those who don\\'t know, here\\'s a quick summary: It\\'s about Vash The Stampede, a legendary gunman who is wanted by many people who stand in his way and bounty hunters all over the planet of Gunsmoke try to catch him, just for the reward of $60,000,000,00 billion dollars. Two agents, Meryl and Milly, finds Vash, only to discover that the legendary gunman is a loving goofball and Vash is on a personal journey to face his demons from his tortured past. That\\'s pretty much how the plot of Trigun is, but it does deliver a few intense and plot twisting moments, that I will not spoil for you guys.The art by Madhouse is fantastic and it still holds up till this day. The western style mixed with technology is very unusual at times, but still pretty nice change of design from the standard style of other genres and character models are well designed, including Vash\\'s cool looking glasses (those glasses always look pretty when the sun shines on them!). Characters are well developed and full of charm and personality, but Vash steals the show for me, because he\\'s such a badass hero. Ok I will admit, at times he\\'s annoying and crazy, but when an enemy threatens to kill innocent people, Vash pulls his gun out and always deflects an enemy\\'s attack (like when he shot the giant metallic hand with 5 bullets). The other characters like Milly and Meryl, the insane priest with an enormous cross Nicholas D. Wolfwood are also fun to watch and some of the villains deliver the best laugh out loud moments in the series.Trigun is an anime that deserves all the critical praise it gained when it debuted in 1998. It\\'s an engaging and non-stop action anime with a very deep story and  a very interesting theme about the morality about killing living things as the series progresses through later episodes. If you missed the series, go check it out or buy the complete series on DVD in store.                                      (PS: Originally posted on June 27, 2011)Now to be honest I wasn’t exactly going into this with high expectations. But I got to admit that I actually started liking it right when the first episode started. It really just clicked that fast for me. This review contains minor spoilers so I won’t be discussing the plot in great detail just so people can read my review and then watch it if they want to.Vashe the Stampede at first glance seems like your typical bad ass western shooter who can’t miss anything he aims at. Well the second part is definitely true but he is definitely                  not your typical bad ass. If he was then it honestly would have been boring. Right in the first episode when they introduce him, he takes aim with his gun towards the villains in this whole cool looking fashion, but then he runs away screaming because he just realized that he forgot to reload his gun. Not only was it funny, but it was very surprising…and I loved it! Vashe the Stampede is a fantastic protagonist who is very unpredictable, and that is what makes him so fun to watch. The thing people also will notice is how the tone of both the story and Vashe\\'s character changes half way through the show. Vashe goes from a comical character to a very serious and dark one. It all feels very natural however and even with all the crazy stuff that happens to him he still manages to slightly keep that comical side of him.The other cast of characters that follow Vashe through out the story are also pulled off well. Meryl and Milly were surprisingly very good and entertaining. The character that really surprised me however was Milly. At first she seems like a dumb, dorky female who would most likely contribute nothing but comic relief…wow, was I wrong. Milly ended up being a person who might not be all there (in the brain that is) but she’s very kind hearted, strong, and willing to achieve whatever she desires. She kind of reminded me of Forrest Gump. She even gets into a relationship with the other supporting character called Wolfwood, who is also very well developed and acts like the opposite of Vashe who believes in different methods of tackling problems and situations. Wolfwood and Milly’s relationship kind of ends sadly but my problem with it is that it could have been a lot better done and even more impactful. Wolfwood and Milly share a relationship that is hinted at through out the show but we never really see much dialogue between the two. If the relationship was a lot more developed, the sad conclusion to it would have been a lot more depressing (in a really good way obviously). As for Meryl she also has her own character arc and she is kind of there to serve as a female support for Vashe. A relationship between Vashe and her is also hinted at but it never goes anywhere...again. Damn it Trigun, if you developed your relationships better, you could have been an amazing Anime!When it comes to the enemies in Trigun, this is where the problems start showing up. The enemies and the actions scenes they contribute to are really great to watch, but my main complaint is, who exactly are these damn enemies? The bad guys are called the “Gung-Ho Guns” and they honestly come out of no where. Who are these people, why are they so strong, and why do they follow the main villain called Knives? Knives on the other hand is actually pretty cool, well developed, and has a pretty good motive. My only problem with his motive is that it basically comes out of no where as well. At first he seems like a very normal boy who is optimistic even though humans treat him like crap, and then two seconds later he’s gone evil and is killing everyone…why and what the hell happened? His story arc after that is good but that beginning part always bugged me. Also, the powers that Vashe and Knives have at their disposal are very intriguing yet it isn’t really much touched upon. Those are some serious crazy powers! Aren’t you going to look into it more…no…fine, be that way!When it comes to the actual story, it is very well told and even though the villains have not much back story, they still contribute to the plot and to the development of the main characters quiet well. Also the futuristic aspect of the story is very cool and I never would have guessed where it was going. I actually watched the English dubbed version of Trigun so sometimes characters would talk when their mouths weren’t moving. I didn’t really care much however because the reason this was done was to have good or at least decent dialogue, dialogue that could not have been achieved if they actually followed with the lip movements of the characters. I’m not exactly sure if I should comment on the animation since I know nothing much about stuff like that, but from what I saw it was ok.In the end, is Trigun actually worth checking out? Yes it definitely is and I had a lot of fun watching it. The characters are very good, especially the main protagonist and if your protagonist is amazing then that is definitely a good sign. I could nit-pick at the shows episodes individually by pointing out all the stupid things. An example would be in episode 21 where in which a friend of Vashe is killed at the end of the episode. They make a very big deal out of it but the problem is that Vashe only knew this friend for like 2 episodes which in Anime time was only a couple of hours. So when Vashe was crying for the loss of his friend, he would enter flashbacks of the only scenes him and this friend had together which happened literally in that episode. It was like, “how could you die friend I’ve only known for a couple of hours and I’ve only been with a couple of times!” Showing those pathetic flashbacks of them being together in that same episode just made it even worse and really funny at the same time. This of course is nit picking and I wouldn’t do that because this show is actually very good and really entertaining. It gets my recommendation stamp :)                                      I found Trigun pretty quickly after I finished Cowboy Bebop, back when I started getting interested in anime. Good thing too, after this I knew I was gonna be hooked on the stuff for a long, long time.Trigun is about a lone gunman, Vash, who has a bounty on his head larger than some countries entire budgets. People don\\'t know anything about this legend of the wasteland, but they know enough to fear him. The other two main characters, Meryl and Milly, are insurance saleswomen, who try their hardest to keep the payouts for Vash\\'s collateral damage to a minimum. It\\'s no easy task, as                  many outlaws and gunslingers want that bounty for themselves no matter the risks. What makes this situation unique is there is no grit in this story, Vash is entirely against violence and refuses to kill under any circumstance even though he is a crack shot. It\\'s quite impressive he\\'s lived as long as he has, but somehow understandable given his boyish charm.The story is largely episodic, showing how in over his head Vash really is, how he struggles to bring the greater good to every settlement he passes through. This is a pretty old show, it came out in 1998, meaning you can expect some near Dragon Ball Z visuals when it comes to villains, and the character design can feel a little strange, but the characters themselves are very solid and their motivations well explained. There are many situations where killing is the quick fix to peace in the west, sometimes the only way, but Vash remains true to his beliefs. This goes from bounty hunters all the way up to a guild of assassins trying to get him, raising the stakes in a slow but steady way. The dialogue is the strongest part of this show, allowing for so much tongue in cheek humour but at times letting you know just how dark things can get. This show deals with escalation quite well, at the end switching to a finale arc where Vash must deal with a mysterious figure from his past with opposite ideas on violence as well as what happened to leave humanity living in squalor in large deserts.Small sections where I felt the show went downhill were detailing some smaller world building elements, such as the power sources of the towns, but you won\\'t really have too long to think about it as it does steer away from these minor loose ends quite well. Certain villain designs are pretty silly, which is to be expected given its age, but it can be hard enough to overlook that. This was my intro to less realistic villains, but I found them to be entertaining. Not quite my style, but done well here just for the different levels of threat they can dish out, really minimising repetitive story elements. The show really hits it\\'s sweet spot when it comes to it\\'s writing and it\\'s soundtrack. There are a lot of \"just one bullet left\" situations that are always difficult to predict and delightful to watch, reinforced by great sounds of rustic guitars and western vibes that build such a great mood throughout the series. Trigun is largely comedic, but it doesn\\'t shy away from darker element like betrayal and zero win scenarios which really test the mettle of the main characters. And trust me, towards the end, the trials are intense.All in all, I found this show a delight to watch, I keep it right below Bebop in my DVD shelf. Well worth a watch, a wonderful anime from 1998 (My favourite year for anime)        ment10                              If you happen to be a fan of Action-comedies, Space-westerns or just something old school, then Trigun is the thing for you. It tells the story about a dangerous, but good hearted Outlaw name Vash the Stampede as he traverse the planet Gunsmoke with two female members of the Bernardelli Insurance Society as they monitor his actions for the fact a huge bounty is been putted on Vash for a a reward.The series starts in a funny humorous way, but along as the series progresses, you get to witness how the history of Vash came to be, alongside with a feud of his brother, Millions                  Knives for what happened to their surrogate mother, Rem Saverem. Along with the introductions of Nicolas D. Wolfwood and Legato Bluesummers, where the tone of the series later shifts into action.Overall all things considered, it\\'s a great series with a classic English dub as well it balances Comedy & Drama perfectly. The props for one would have to go with the Music composed by Tsuneo Imahori who did a great job for creating the atmosphere of the moments of the series. Including the opening theme and the use of Western Ambience.        0                              Synopsis •\\tSpace Western •\\tComedic Protagonist that dislikes killing anyone – even the bad guys (which is elaborated on)•\\tAn episodic format is used to establish characters and setting with a linear narrative woven throughout leading to dire consequences and a satisfying conclusion.•\\tA must see for any anime veteran – at least deserving of a chance.

The whimsy just adds to the impact of the serious moments, and it isn\\'t afraid to use subtlety at the cost of people missing things.I appreciate that fact that the approached a difficult issue like pacifism, but the fantastical nature of the setting has an impact on it\\'s applicability to real life moral dilemmas.                               Trigun - 8/10Probably one of the most uncertain characters i\\'ve ever seen. From time to time you can\\'t really tell if Vash is being a fool playing a serious baddass, or he is a serious baddass pretending to be a fool.And this is what this show fundamentally builds itself on.

However. While there are similarities to no end, i believe Trigun deserves a lot more applause, for making it\\'s characters a little more interesting, maybe they are more one-sided than the \"Space Cowboy\" characters, but they are just as entertaining to watch. I also believe the world in Trigun is done much and much better, being more interesting and more vivid, MUCH more vivid. It\\'s definitely a must-watch experience, the characters, the world and the action are best things. Even though i can see some budget spread problems, which causes episodes 2-8 look bad in comparison to the rest of the series and towards the end of the series, a lot of still frames are present, which is annoying. Half-way through the show we get offered a backstory and a plot starts forming. The OST is amazing, it switches from traditional Rock somewhere to Alternative Blues to only then switch to Ambient or Post-Industrial or even Noise.\"We\\'re not like god, not only our powers are limited, but somtimes we have to play the devil\" Maybe this anime isn\\'t exactly revolutionary in any sort of sense, maybe this anime is actually worse than bebop in every way but i was still very entertained to watch it, which is why it earns a very good 8/10o end, i believe Trigun deserves a lot more applause, for making it\\'s characters a little more interesting, maybe they are more one-sided than the \"Space Cowboy\" characters, but they are just as entertaining to watch.

There are like, no trees by the way. There are a couple, but they are few and far between. But that doesn\\'t do the characters or the story justice. Not at all. Which brings me to how I want to talk about the characters and how the show itself lays itself out.Vash the Stampede I think, could be considered one of the most unique protagonists of all time. We see how skilled he is, in                  fact he is godlike levels of skilled mentally and physically. But Vash is far from perfect and part of what makes him so great is his inner struggle to do what\\'s right the right way, and whether or not what he does and how he thinks is right à la our primary foil Nicholas D. Wolfwood (another likable yet somewhat anti heroic character) and the various villains he meets. However, Vash himself can also be a major turn off from the show itself because I have found that people find him obnoxious and grating. I would have to disagree as whatever he has that makes him obnoxious or grating is also part of how well his character is written, but he is for sure a make-it or break-it for this show, as it\\'s all very focused on him.Now of course what\\'s also important is Trigun\\'s \"structure.\" The first half of Trigun is highly episodic and fleshes out it\\'s interesting if not gritty world and it\\'s characters, especially our blonde blue eyed hero Vash and to a degree the other proteagonists that remain constants like Milly, Meryl, and Nicholas D. Wolfwood (Vash\\'s foil). This episodic approach works pretty well and because of it the cast is incredibly hard to forget. Part of this episodic approach is also mainly because it is a sort of \"filler\" from the original manga (read that shit too) but despite this is still highly entertaining. So for bit, Trigun remains a show that is part action, part comedy, part philosophical, a bit dark, and entirely fun. Then, we have the second half. It keeps all of the action, most of the comedy, but gets much darker. Because in the second half of Trigun we get a concrete plot and an exploration of Vash\\'s past and the part he plays in the world that has been developed. It\\'s here I think that Trigun really hits the top of my list and stays there nigh unmovable. It\\'s here that Trigun\\'s themes of morality and doing the \"right\" thing are examined. It introduces bad guys that directly conflict with Vash in more than just a physical sense leading to the end villain: The cat in every episode. Yes, it\\'s the cat. Just kidding, you\\'ll have to watch the show to see how everything plays out.Now, you have to keep in minds that this came out in the 90\\'s and it looks a bit dated. It is nonetheless very fluid with it\\'s animation and the action is fantastic. You could also argue that it\\'s dated look adds to the show\\'s charm in how gritty the world of Trigun is. Over all, it does it\\'s job well and I have for the most part have no complaints with it despite the age. So now we have one more category I would like to address. That would be the sound which includes both the OST and voice acting. The soundtrack, is in fact great. It has a slight shriek to it along with fitting guitar and funky synth. It works incredibly well with Trigun and to top it off the voice acting is pretty much perfect as well, subbed and dubbed. The subbed version is great, the voice actors all fit and do excellent jobs. Yet, I have to say watch the dub. Because as well as the Japanese actors fit nothing can compare to the English ones. I will defend Trigun\\'s dub to the very end due to A. how well it fits the western theme and B. because of the voice actors themselves. Now I will tell you that I want to have sex with a couple of voices in this world. Two of those are Johnny Yong Bosch and Jeff Nimoy. Guess who plays Vash and Nicholas? Those two, and to this day I think there are not more perfect voices for them, Johnny with his ridiculously soft and almost... angelic voice which is perfect for Vash and Nemoy\\'s cool but kind of rough voice that does Wolfwood\\'s original kansai dialect English justice.So if there\\'s anything that I hope you got from this 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8 (holy shit) paragraph review it\\'s that I thoroughly enjoyed Trigun and I think you might too if you give it a shot.Trigun gets a 10/10 from me and I do not regret watching it.        10                              Trigun is one of the series that you can show to anyone, anime lover or hater and chances are they\\'ll find something to like in this. It\\'s story is wonderful, the art beautiful and the characters quirky and lovable, not to mention some of the most memorable. It\\'s known as one of the Great Classics anime wise, a title that it certainly deserves. To start off, the story is great. The series starts off with enjoyable one-shot stories that, though not giving much away plot wise, tell more about the characters than some entire series do. And once we get more into the plot itself                  and the silliness of those early epsiodes starts to die down to be replaced by darker themes, it just gets better. Unlike the original manga, Trigun the anime doesn\\'t give everything away to early, choosing instead to give you hints and clues until fairly late in the series. In fact, there are certain elements that aren\\'t even explained in the anime that remain buried in the manga. While it\\'s quite well known that Trigun takes some dark turns towards the end, it defienetly doesn\\'t become as dark as it could have, always throwing in the ocasional joke to lighten the mood without seeming forced. I don\\'t really think this is a bad thing though. Without the jokes, the series very well could have turned way too depressing for many of the fans who started watching Trigun expecting, or at least hoping, for the series to stick with those goofy little episodes at the beginning. While this is true though, potential watchers should be warned that there is a chance they will cry at least once in this series, I know I did.Now, I think before I get into the sound or art I should talk about the characters since they\\'re pretty much the heart and soul of Trigun.Our protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wanted fellon with $$60 000 000 000 on his head. But (aside from rip-offs) this is pretty much the only series you\\'ll find where that wanted fellow can be hurt shounting \"Love and peace!\" Vash\\'s character is great! One of the most memorable in all of anime, from his red jacket to his odd looking sunglasses.Next up we have the insurance girls, Milly and Meryl. Good luck remembering which is which. Stupid silimar names... These girls, while seeming similar at first, have very different personalities, but like with most characters in Trigun, there\\'s much more to them than meets the eye. Last for main characters is Wolfwood, a character who is arguably more popular amounst fans than even Vash. He\\'s a clergy man who loves kids (not like that, you pervert!) and guns. Great combination, huh? His character is probably one of the hardest to talk about without spoilers since he only appears over a third of the way through the series and even then doesn\\'t have as much screen time as you\\'d expect, so let\\'s just say he\\'s very much like Vash, but at the same time a total opposite and leave it at that.For fear of spoilers, I won\\'t talk about antagonists other than this: Only maybe three of all the ones who appear are shown in more than one episode. Those three, my friend, are badass.The art in Trigun is an interesting thing to talk about considering it was based more of the style of western comics than it was manga or anime since the author was a fan of such. (If you keep an eye out you can notice some references to comics such as Spiderman.) This causes the characters to have a very distinct look which works most of the time, but when the animation budget is down, these character designs can looks kinda odd... It\\'s not that noticable though, and therefore not too much of an issue. The character designs themselves are all quite nice, a lot of them, like everything else it seems, very memorable.And finally we come to sound. Language wise both the English and Japanese are very good and perfectly listenable. If I had to choose one, I\\'d say the Japanese is a touch better, but Vash himself is better in English in terms of serious scenes and I don\\'t want to disperage all the things the dub got right, so just go with your preferance. Musically, there isn\\'t much that stands out. That\\'s not to say it\\'s bad at all, but most of it seems to just sort of fad into the background. However, the music that you notice, you NOTICE. Opening theme included, there were only three pieces that really stood out to me, and when I heard those, I sat up and paid attention because I knew that things were about to get interesting if they weren\\'t already. Overall, this is a wonderful series, bot with an awesome plot and gloriously complex characters. Like any series, it has it\\'s problems, but those are easily overlooked in the grand scheme of things. I personally had a great time watching Trigun and I hope you will too if you haven\\'t already. And so, I give this pascifistic gun show a 9 out of 10.        t10                              Trigun is an extremely original series so there isn\\'t much you can critique about it. It\\'s very well-done, well executed, and the story is fascinating. It never hurts to re-watch this series because there\\'s a lot you may have missed the first time                              Trigun is classical anime from -98.Story:Story was really mixed bag for me. Story itself was interesting and it had depth but it was executed poorly. First 12 episodes felt rather pointless to me. Vash goes to some place with girls an then saves someone from evil villain and thats the episode. The main story starts to kick in from 12 episode but even then it moves too slowly. Last 5 episodes were best in this series but the ending was little disapointing to me. 15min of gun shooting and thats it. Art:This area is hard to rate because this is a little older anime and                  I don\\'t know what were the standarts in -98 because I have watched too few this old anime series. Art was to my eye decent but not great. It still filled its duty.Sound:Nothing remakable. Opening was good but thats it.Characters:This was the best part of this series. All main characters were interesting. Vash was particularly interesting. His personality was so complex. Sometimes he made joke of all things and then again sometimes he was very serious. Other characters like Wolfwood (the most badass priest ever) and Legolas (Toshiko Seki never lets you down when he voices a evil character) were great. Girls felt rather unimportant but they didn\\'t annoy me. Filled their place nicely.Enjoyment:When I take all things into account I enjoyed this series. I didn\\'t get bored with any episode but I didn\\'t really love any episode either. Overall:Overall this anime was a little let down. I expected maybe little too much when I watched the score what this has gotten here. Anime was good but its story was so poorly executed that  it didn\\'t really suck me in like some series. Still I didn\\'t regret to watch this. Maybe the story just goes better to other people.nt10                              ~possible SPOILERS~I have written a review for this anime before, but it was terrible and Trigun deserves better, so here goes again.I own a good portion of this anime in the english dubbed version (including two VHS tapes, thats how long ago I fell in love with Trigun) and I find myself popping it in when I want to relax or wind down from a long day.  It\\'s the kind of anime you can\\'t get enough of, I just love it.  Story:  I really enjoyed the story, but as it did get a 9/10 I did feel that it was lacking in                  a coupe places.  First - I wanted to know more about the connection between Vash/Knives and the Plants.  You never actually get a good look at the Plants, but I think the manga version expands on this part of the plot a bit (I have not read the manga, only thumbed through it at the bookstore).  Two - there also is an obvious subliminal romance going on between Vash and Meral, I think this could have been developed more, but that might just be the kind of guy Vash is?  Other then these two parts the rest of the anime is very entertaining story wise, and the filler episodes are minimal.Art:  As I mentioned eariler, Trigun was originally released on VHS, so you would expect older art styles.  Trigun does have sort of a faded color scheme, like the technology of the time is showing through, but the way the show is done is very aesthetically pleasing.  As I was watching the VHS the other day, I actually thought about how detailed and anatomically correct the art was.  Sound:  One of my favorite parts of this anime is the sound!!  Along with half the show on VHS/DVD I also have the soundtrack.  The music is amazing, its a mixture of techno, rock, and country/wild west.  I\\'d almost have to say the music alone is enough of a reason to watch the show.Character:  The characters in the show are unforgettable.  Aside from the main characters, the secondary characters and villains are also colorful and well developed.  You can\\'t wait to watch the next episode just to find out who they\\'re going to meet next.  It received a 9/10 because I wanted to know more about Vash/Knives as well as the possible romance between Vash and Meral.Enjoyment: 10!  This show is comical, serious, and action packed!  The story is a fantastic science fiction.  The characters are great, and the music is iPod worthy.Overall it gets a 10/10!  Watch Trigun, you will love it, I promise!                                      When I started to watch this anime I was under the assumption it was just going to be another shoot \\'em up pointless killer story. Similar to the type Ninja Scroll (the series) was like. My cousin showed me a couple episodes of it, and I was not impressed at all. There didn\\'t seem to be much point to it. Well that was starting at a random episode. Despite my feelings toward the anime I gave it a shot anyways. To my surprise it was much better than It let on to be. It was very suspenseful for the first couple episodes, it made me                  want to keep going on. After awhile the details of the show became evident. It was far more in depth than I first thought. Unlike some characters from animes where the main characters are pretty flat, Trigun does character development quite well, especially with Vash. Like with many good characters there is FAR more to the character than meets the eye. Or even what is told about the character. What is so great about this anime it keeps you guessing what the truth behind the character\\'s actions are.The story was written very well.  It was quite enjoyable. if you are looking for something a bit more than shoot \\'em up anime. That is more than none stop action. If you are looking for something that has depth but still has the action many desire... Trigun may be for you. Even after my initial thoughts about Trigun, it ended up surprising me and being very good! I would recommend this anime to have people watch at least once.Overall Score: 9 / 10Rewatch Value: Medium10                              I can say with absolute confidence that Trigun is one of the best series I have ever seen. It had a very good story, one of the most interesting and complex main characters, an excellent soundtrack, great action, hilarious comedic moments and some pretty serious drama, especially in the latter half. If you watch anime, Trigun is a must-watch.The story starts off a bit slow, we got this cool, yet goofy dude who has a 60 billion double-dollar bounty on him, and for the first half of the series it\\'s pretty episodic, Vash goes to a new town, followed by Meryl and Milly, causes some                  destruction and laughs, shows that he\\'s a good person in spite of his enormous bounty. To some it could seem that the story is going nowhere. However, in the latter half it takes a new direction, a darker and more mysterious road. The story unfolds rapidly, Vash\\'s past is revealed, the reason for his bounty and these people who want to harm him are also gradually shown. To me, the story just starts off slow and gradually accelerates, without going over the speed limit. Good pacing.The art and animation is quite good considering this is from 10 years ago. Vash looks kickass with that red coat and those shades of this, especially when he\\'s out kicking some ass. However, there are some QUALITY moments, such as still shots when you can see that some bits are lacking detail, but it doesn\\'t spoil the series much.The soundtrack is pretty awesome, it has some awesome electric guitar, heard in the OP and kickass moments, yet it also has some peaceful, acoustic guitar pieces which fit in really well with the emotional and dramatic scenes. And the Trigun dub is of extreme high quality, I actually like it more than the sub, mainly because Meryl\\'s Japanese voice was too soft, and it really fits well with the Western theme of Trigun.The best aspect of Trigun definitely lies within its character, especially Vash. Vash is seriously one hell of a character. He\\'s hilarious and goofy but he can be serious when the situation calls for it, is an expert gunman, has values and a mysterious and tragic past. Some may call Vash a Mary Sue or a moralfag, because he is an extreme pacifist, cool and awesome, but I heavily disagree. True, he may come off annoying with his \\'no killing\\' values, but he is truly a character who believes in peace and love straight to the heart, and it\\'s quite evident from flashbacks to his past and as the story progresses. And it\\'s very touching to see how far he is willing to go to stick to them. Also, all this horrible shit happens to him in his past, and during the series even though he\\'s done absolutely nothing to deserve them, yet he is still able to maintain such a positive, empathetic and compassionate personality. He is truly incredible as a person, and this is strengthened by his twin brother Knives, who is the polar opposite of Vash (\\'Survival of the fittest\\', loves to cause harm and destruction, especially to Vash).Truth be told, it really hurts to see Vash, who is such a wonderful person, suffer so much in the series from stuff that would change any person. Yet, that also allows us to see that Vash is truly incredible.The other characters are also quite outstanding on their own. Nicholas D Wolfwood, a travelling priest/fuckawesome gunman, is quite different from Vash, yet similar and just as complex. Milly and Meryl are great for comedic relief, and they allow us to see Vash as a character through different angles. The villains and bad guys, some of them are not actually evil, and they themselves also have some very interesting backgrounds and reasons why they want to hunt Vash. Basically, there is a lot of character development in just about everybody.I enjoyed Trigun hell of a lot, I loved watching Vash and Wolfwood go shoot shit up, Vash\\'s hilarious antics, the awesome soundtrack, the interesting story, it\\'s really entertaining to watch, and it really makes you think about why Vash acts like how he is, and (in a non-preachy way) how important it is to care about others and be empathetic. It also shows you true pain and suffering, and how it has detrimental effects on everybody, even to those who inflict it, and that there is always a chance to turn back despite the evils one might have done. It\\'s probably the most dramatically interesting and touching series I\\'ve ever had the luck of coming across. If you\\'re in for action, comedy, good characters and some serious drama, this is an excellent series for you.        nt9                              Many of my anime friends said \"you have to watch this.\"  I finally buckled down and decided to watch the whole series.  The one thing that everyone says is DO NOT STOP WATCHING; YOU HAVE TO WATCH THE WHOLE THING!  The first few episodes were cute, but nothing i would choose to watch on my own.  BUT i did not stop watching.  The story, the characters, and even the setting take a 180 degree turn, and blow you away.Episode 13 is particularly where the drastic change occurs, BUT if you dont watch the previous 12 episodes, it wont be seem                  all that spectacular.  It would be like opening a book and starting at the middle.  You need the character build-up of Vash, the main character.The story, action, characters, and suspense make this anime above most others.  What is human kind?: are we beings that need compassion that are innately good, or are we filth that needs to be exterminated?0                              Beliefs. Convictions. Morals. These aspects of the human thought process are among the most powerful motivators on this planet. In this series, Trigun, one man\\'s beliefs are put to the test. Let the review begin.Story 9/10The story of Trigun seems straight-forward: a space gunslinger who wanders around gets a bounty on his head and now must run for his life, helping people along the way. However, the story goes much deeper than that. The first half of the series is a day-to-day life approach Vash the Stampede, the protagonist, as well as the antics of his two lady...um, followers, Milly Thompson and Meryl Strife. Along                  they way they also come across a priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood. What starts off as a relatively light-heart action comedy takes a turn for the dark around the time Wolfwood enters the picture. The audience begins to see that there is a secret to Vash. His motto for \"no killing\" plays a very important role in the story and all is not as it seems. The show begins to pick the pace shortly after Wolfwood\\'s premier and by the time the conclusion rolls around, the despair within both Vash and the audience is powerful. There are some very powerful scenes in this anime and its not really because of the violence. In fact, for a sci-fi gun-fighting action adventure, there is not as much shooting as one would think. Violence serves more as a vehicle for Vash\\'s ideological struggles rather than just for audience entertainment. Does this make the anime boring to watch? No, just know that firefights are not the center. As far as the ending goes, its mixed. It certainly deserved more action, but it also explains alot about Vash\\'s past, which is great. However, it would have been better if they could have made two episodes rather than cram a final fight AND a flashback in the same 23 minutes. Art 7/10Easily the weakest part of the series. The character designs are great. Each character has their own unique look and feel, with some designs being better than others. That being said, the animation is sub-par. It has not aged well at all and its a real shame because some of the talking scenes are better animated than the action ones. In addition, there are quality dips and overall, there are times where its simply not nice to look at. That being said, the art direction is good. I would have never anticipated such a unique world on a desolate wasteland. The scifi and the western elements blend beautifully, allowing the world to come alive. However, the poor, aged animations counterbalance it...Sound 9/10 With music, the mood is set rather nicely. While I can\\'t name too many BGMs off the top of my head, they certainly capture the appropriate feelings for each scene. The opening is a nice guitar instrumental and the ending is decent as well. Other notable tracks include Rakuen Paradise, Scattered Rain and Sound Life.The voice acting as whole was also good too. It takes a while to get used to some of them, like Wolfwoods, but others, like Vash and the Bernardelli Insurance girls, fit perfectly. Characters 8/10Much of this story has to do with character development, so I won\\'t go in too deep. I\\'ll say that:1. Vash and his motto to not kill are fully explained and his own character differentiates him from similar \"no kill\" protagonists like, say, Himura Kenshin from Rurouni Kenshin.2. The Insurance girls, Meryl and Milly, are more than just sidekicks. While their pasts aren\\'t explored too much, their current relationships with each other, Vash and the world certainly changes throughout the story, making them contributing characters to feel of the anime. 3. In a nutshell, Wolfwood is a priest who kills. Like Vash, his story is tied to the plot but I will say that he is certainly on par with Vash in the development department or one could actually argue he changes more than Vash.4. The Gung-ho guns and others characters: The cast of Trigun is full of guest stars. They show up for one episode and then disappear into the sunset. This is not a bad way of telling a story but they begin to seem less like characters and more like ways to show how Vash evolves. The Gung-ho guns, the main antagonists in the series, have one mission: make Vash\\'s life hell. Most of these members are nothing more than one trick ponies, but the few that are good are very well written. Overall, the main cast is strong, as are a few Villains, but most of the other characters aren\\'t up to snuff. Enjoyment 10/10 While I had my issues with it, I never dreaded watching Trigun. The only reason why it took so long to finish was because I got caught up the the newest series. However, Trigun does not punish you for leaving it. It eases you back in without a hiccup and with a great cast, insightful observations on the ideas of humanity vs society, the worth of life and the power of the past, and finally a nice score, Trigun is certainly a series to remember.  Overall, Trigun is a great anime that, while a bit dated graphically, tells a story unlike any other and has a cast that is worth all the tears you might shed, wheter they are from laughter or despair. A must see for classical junkies, especially!        ment10                              A Trigun review, in my opinion must be conducted in 2 parts: What a) \"happens\" and  b) what actually happens. Please note, it may seem like I\\'m rambling but I promise it leads somewherea)Trigun is imperfect. The first thing this statement makes you think after seeing my overall rating of the show should raise a question or two. How can an imperfect show receive a 10/10? Trigun is about the exploits of Vash the Stampede, a wanted criminal. Vash is the type of person who brings disasters in his wake. These disasters all occur due to his ideal \"Nobody has the right to take                  the life of another\". That\\'s right, a man with a 60 billion $$ bounty wouldn\\'t hurt a fly. That\\'s most people call a contradiction. Trigun is a show about a contradiction contracting other contradictions. Trigun is a show about themes.Trigun\\'s main theme is morality. Not the debate over whether killing is right, but the consequences of not killing men who stop at nothing to kill you. They employ any tactic, such as threatening and attempting to kill innocent bystanders. Vash of course is against this practice by his very nature and does something, if it\\'s in his power, to stop this. Meaning, Vash does not always save everybody. Sometimes it\\'s because he simply can\\'t do anything, other times it\\'s because of the intervention of a third party. This is something that eats away at Vash, so episodes are added to show Vash recovering from these mental blows. These seemingly randomly thrown in episodes create the one flaw of Trigun: pacing issues. Sometimes the show moves with incredible speed, and other times it may not move at all.This part is rather hard to explain if you haven\\'t watched Trigun, but I\\'ll do my best. Part of Trigun\\'s perfection is it\\'s imperfection. Vash admits many times that he is imperfect, that not killing one man can result in other people dying. Every character is presented with two conflicting personalities, the combination of which result in an imperfect person. Trigun takes it\\'s characters seriously and pits the imperfect characters against each other, but never crucifying and killing characters because of their imperfections. The imperfections always play a part, but never decide the outcome. What I\\'m trying to say is that Trigun is like a human being. It isn\\'t perfect, but if you adopt another of Vash\\'s ideals and place your faith in the humanity of others, they never hurt you. If you believe in Trigun, if you accept that it can\\'t be perfect because of it\\'s focus on ideals and morality, it becomes something entirely different to watch. \"Wait, so you have to ignore it\\'s imperfections for Trigun to be perfect? Couldn\\'t any other show ask you to that and be perfect to?\" This is why it\\'s hard to explain. Trigun never asks you to ignore it\\'s imperfections, but the actions and thoughts of Vash influence the audience into thinking like he does. Either way, this particular theme is one of many Trigun explores, and exploring this one them is enough fro a review. Should you want to experience the other  themes, thoughts, and actions of Vash watch the show.How is this about what \"happens\"? Most of what makes Trigun great is that what airs on the screen and is said by the characters has implications that viewers have to stop and think about while the show pushes on. This is essentially a second plot, focusing on the reasons behind action. Any other show could be great if the same logic is applied, right? Wrong. Trigun does this without a second thought, never stopping the main plot while continuously adding the second one. Again, it\\'s hard to explain, but if the profound feelings and thoughts Trigun inspires inside audiences were easily tangible and converted into words, many other shows would also exist.b)Trigun has a relatively standard plot, beat the bad guy, help citizens. The second plot enhances the first one, making a standard plot far more entertaining. This plot doesn\\'t occur right away though,as the first few episodes introduce you to Vash, and all the sides of his character. This is actually necessary due to how deep his character is.The art of Trigun is dated. Some think of it as a weakness, but I feel that it adds to the atmosphere of the show. Ina wild west setting the dated art makes it seem even more wild west, or at least to me. Trigun also features one of the best sound tracks, with epic guitar music being played at the perfect time. The soundtrack is also enjoyable with no show in front of it.Overall, Trigun is a very enjoyable show with some awesome atmospheres, themes, thoughts, and feelings all centered around Vash. Trigun successfully accomplishes what it sets out to do: be fun and serious, good and bad, right and wrong. If this review makes no sense before watching Trigun, I apologize. Trigun is really hard to put into words. All I can say that makes definite sense is that you have to watch this show.        0                              Classic. Unforgettable, and when you do forget, you\\'d want to repeat watching the oh so reluctant part where people tend to forget against the test of time.An outstanding kind of action, gun fighting, hero-lone-warrior kind of anime.The hero.It has been all about him from the beginning and end of the series. Joking around but tends to be serious when life is at stake. He had done things in the past that he regretted, due to his naivety, a fault that is safe to say all can relate. He is a classic hero, but a hero that is influential to the heroes of today. So it\\'s                  kind of, he is the hero of the leagues of heroes of anime. Quite.ps. I like the ending. Leaves you a feeling of wanting more, but satisfied. A sure way it was a great watch.burp!         nt10                              Trigun is a really tricky anime to review or reccomend because it is difficult to go into detai, even broad details, without spoiling some aspects of the series so I will try review it while spoiling as little as possible.The show is listed as an action, sci-fi, comedy and that is pretty accurate. However, somewhere a long the way the show becomes something else entirely. While the big change the show goes through can be polarizing, I think that it really works and is the reason this show is still held in such a high regard. Trigun might not end up being the anime you                  think it is, but I would still recommend it to anyone who likes westerns, comedy, or action.What I can say about the show is that the animation holds up fine, the music is great, it has one of the greatest protagonists I have ever seen in anime, a handful of other great main characters, some really intersting villians. The show has a big variety in tone that can go from being funny to sad, romantic, action packed, depressing, emotional, or anything in between.I think that Trigun is still talked about today, nearly 20 years since it first aired because of its endearing, well written, and memorable characters and a story that continually surprises the audience with real emotional stakes.Side note, the Dub is pretty awesome and deserves a watch.        t10                              Trigun is one of those animes that one does not simply watch but experience, I had first come upon this anime while watching odd clips on youtube, it had been bits of the first episode that had seen that got me to go out and search for this anime. After watching the first episode I was surprised at how enjoyable it was with its simple plot at the start making it easy for one to get into the show, it helped snowball my interest in the anime. By the time I got halfway through the series I was fully invested in the story, Vash is                  probably one of my faviourt characters in anime with his complex view on things making him so much more than a simple main character.  Every time Vash felt something, a part of me felt it too, this was especially true for the moments that are sad.But while we are on the topic of characters, let\\'s take a moment to appreciate the side character, from the supporting cast of Wolfwood, Meryl and Mill, to the unique bad guys in the gung-ho guns. All the characters were thoroughly enjoyable and most bounced well off Vash and his personality. The story is a lovely mix of revenge quest with psychological aspects such as morality and whether taking a human life is right by any means, this is well executed and allow the watcher to work out a conclusion on their own. As a whole, the anime is one of my all time favs, it will be one that I will forever hold dear to my heart.                                          Trigun is a good anime. It has a slow start which continues for a first few episodes but then quickly escalates and before you know it we\\'re halfway through, a decent development but it feels rushed until the end. It has fairly satisfactory conclusion. The story is one of uncommon types and its execution is done well but like i mentioned, it feels rushed. The character buildup is very good, our MC is a complete badass (sorta reminded me of Luffy from One Piece). The Artwork and the sound might be outdated but this isn\\'t a bad anime. The anime was aired in 1998 so                  you would expect this art but it\\'s pretty decent for that time. Same goes for its soundtracks, they are amazing but they aren\\'t bad either. It\\'s definitely worth watching if you don\\'t have anything else to watch. It was quite entertaining but i wouldn\\'t re-watch it. I personally didn\\'t like it because of the old-styled dialogues and story build-up but the badass MC made sure i watched i through. It is definitely worth a try, do watch the first few episodes before judging it.                                       I watched this show many, many years ago, and will simply tell you my impressions of it from many, many years ago. This is because I don\\'t want to watch it again, ever.It\\'s basically Rurouni Kenshin with robo-cowboys and much, much worse animation. I guess I wouldn\\'t have minded so much if I hadn\\'t seen RRK beforehand, possibly because Kenshin came out first. Well, okay, the plots aren\\'t entirely the same but the main characters are rather similar and then I was constantly irritated by how low budget the animation was. Kenshin was stylish. Trigun\\'s animation is just...blergh. That\\'s the word, blergh. If you haven\\'t                  seen RRK or hate samurai, then perhaps you will enjoy Trigun. It\\'s 3/5 across the board except for the animation, which isn\\'t the worst in the world but then I do like to have animation in my animation.        t9                              Who is Vash the Stampede? That single question is the fuel for the story of Trigun. While his identity is unknown, his legend is unmatched. As you learn of his past and make predictions about his future, that question will guide you on a fantastic journey through the desert with the mysterious 60 billion$$ man.Story 10/10Trigun is usually put in the category of \"must watch in your anime life\" and I completely agree. This story is great because of the shift in pace and attitude. It starts out slow and with a lot of stupid humor, but once the main story kicks in it is                  a road towards the real Vash and his true destiny. People who drop this series in the first 5 episodes, I ask you to strongly reconsider because you haven\\'t even touched the real story of Trigun. I don\\'t want to spoil anything but the characters and events the are introduced will have you yearning for more.Characters 10/10The character development in Trigun is outstanding, focusing on Vash, Milly, and  Meryl.  I love how the relationship between the three of them develops and how you learn about all of their backrounds. As well as the comic relief that they bring when the show can get emotionally down.Art 8/10 Sound 8/10The art is great for its time but it is old school and many people find it unattractive. Some things can be inconsistent at times, like dimensions and angles, but I personally thought that the rough old style fits perfectly with the desert setting. SFX and music in this show are great as well. The music fits in perfectly with the setting allowing you to really feel the mood they want to establish. As well as the OP guitar riffs preparing you for action and the soothing ending wrapping up the eventful episode.Overall 9/10In total this show is very enjoyable with a thoughtful and emotional story and a wide variety of character personalities. Episode after episode you will find yourself falling in love with Vash and encouraging him through his struggles as he crosses the desert; while both Vash and yourself look for the answer to the question, who is Vash the Stampede...        nt10                              In the incoming end of the late 90s, with Anime popularity starting to spread across the world and the word &quot;Otaku&quot; seemlingly appears not a deragotory term, anymore. Such hits like Akria, Gundams, shoujo to shonen, and much of the craziness of Japanese culture, domainating at(or at very least) the Western hemosphere. You wouldn\\'t believe that anime could be quite a trend to the Western hemosphere, through the sterotypical times much similar to those of fantasy-related people whom people believed that they are overweight and still living at their parents\\' house. Much like the similarity of the Nintendo Entertainment System, launching in New York but                  with less quality than quantity. Even though, these sterotypical times through a piece of Japanese culture in our lives, yet its too addictive to not watch/read it. It could/or not be a hinderance to those whom watched a dish of American culture and read comics. each day. And yet back then with Anime was introduced to the Western Hemiosphere. it wasn\\'t that popular/yet uncool to enjoy it, unlike reading DC/Marvel comics with the awe-rocking entertainment.Much of that turned during the late-90s and the introduction of the 20th century, when Anime was soon appeared to have volunteers or known voice actors to dubbed the anime. While some failed and others were mediocore, we were introduced but a unpresedented company, Sunrise. Whom was among popular with mecha anime/Gundams and created one of the true treasured anime that invented the word &quot;cool&quot; to Anime. Cowboy Bebop, it seems to be a success in the United States with a type of music, that was never heard in Anime culture. Jazz/Blues and the way that the artist/composer, Yoko Konno can create such of an awe-inspiring Blues soundtrack. And yet, without this kind of musical performance, or if Yoko Kanoo was directing it, it would just like Outlaw Star. These musical performance might be inspired by such famous performances like Louis Armstrong and such. After the popularity of Cowboy Bebop and probably Samurai Champloo, Yasuhiro Nightow and under the art direction of Madhouse Studios directed another anime that is in the same led of &quot;coolness&quot; and yet to either cowboys or samurai. That anime was Trigun, much leading the same genre to Cowboy Bebop, Sci-fi, Comedy to Action-oriented/Drama. Both has its key moments and similarites but wasn\\'t apparicated enough towards now. The valor of both Cowboy Bebop and Trigun created a great atmosphere with its music, drama and excitement to others. Seemlingly set in the same vibe as Cowboy Bebop has, a deserted environment. Much has realized that this could be much cliche, it appealed as that the protangist in this Anime is a Pacifist. Vash the Stampende but as well known as the &quot;Humanoid Typhoon&quot;, as it was rumored and speculatated that this &quot;Typhoon&quot; caused the destruction of July. It is now known that Vash carry a bounty on his head, much similarity of Rurouni Kenshin as a wandering samuari, Vash is wandering marked bounty whom both want peace but everyone is out to get them. Vash\\'s bounty is set more than 6billion dollars as similar to Spike Spiegel whom is to the lesser value(or probably molawns could be a higher a value) as well as Kenshin. Unlike lesser similarites between Kenshin, Vash seems to have two personalities: one personality seems to be Comedic at its own right, as Vash uses this as to not draw attention from others whom saught get his bounty, spreading &quot;love and peace&quot; remarks and valuing the lives of others, feeling symphony for their life and a person whom cheers others up at this point of sadness. The other is revenge/selfish sacifices or suicide, when someone in value gets killed/injured, turning into these so-called &quot;Typhoon&quot; others speculating to kill the ones whom killed them. Thus so, Vash also values the lives as those ones whom are after him, regretting to ever killed them as he is scared of blood. Enter Meryl and Milly, both working in the Insurance Co. whom is investigating Vash, as their job. Throughout the episodes, Meryl and Milly, especially Meryl seems confused to unable to understand. that this fun-loving peace Pacifist is living a life through helping people(as Kenshin does that too) and just as a normal person. It was soon speculated that through the events of the anime, Meryl saw/speculate that this isn\\'t the Vash, she saw. Confused as she is, unable to trust Vash to his words, as everyone is after him for: greedness, selfish, orders from their master and being homeless/poor, vengance.Vash in regards shared that symphony with others, and managed to help them as best as he can. Seemlingly Meryl and Milly created more attention to others, while others theorized, speculate, contradict that Vash did utmost destruction to their lives through this belief. As the antonagist and others used this advantage to take the blame to Vash, as he was marked. Throughout these episodes, Vash attempt to be generous to others, and keeping a oath to his only parent, Rem. As Rem stated that she wishes to have a haven of peace and prosperity and Vash wishes to keep that oath that Rem wished. Remembering the song that Rem created to remembrance of her. Making this relationship possible to the ones shared with Spike Spiegel and his love. Vash\\'s true purpose in this entirely, was to save/kill his brother whom is opposite to him, after his brother, Knives massacre the lives of Vash\\'s beloved friends and his love/parent, Rem. Disdaining Humans as: selfish, arrogant, insolent and imperfect organism and waiting to get rid of humankind as of people criticizing both Vash and Knives as Monsters. Through Vash, Meryl and Milly\\'s adventure, a priest on the same vain towards Vash, Nicolas Wolfwood through to spread the light on people. As generous as Vash, Wolfwood accompany him, through his adventures. Spreading peace and helping others. Throughout the course of the anime, Vash, Wolfwood, Meryl and Milly encounter the Gun-Ho gang whom whose scared Vash and manipulate others into believing Vash is a killer. Legato who doesn\\'t values his life to torment others. This struggle between Vash knowing that prejudice, contradiction, assumptions and beliefs, suffered him badly but to a extent, has the redemption to meet his brother, Knives again.The art presentation of Trigun is quite good but not great. Under the direction of MadHouse designing this anime. Many characteristics of anime art between back-then and now is quite similar. Trigun has many flaws on regards to its artistic presentation, the most common flaw is character design. Many of those encounter Vash, and others seems to have the same build as others, appealing before. Most of the time, some males seems to look similar to females and females as males, confusing at first but understandable later. The textures of these designs, represent uncreative ideas surrounding their character design as well as some environment events. Yes, this is in fact created in the 90s but to be honest, Cowboy Bebop seemlingly have creative to simplistic character design that seems more appealing. While the other flaw is in most of the anime right now, seemlingly, confusing male/female designs as they awkwardly whose voiced under. It doesn\\'t give a huge mark on the series, although the antoganist to menacing villians in this anime has a depth of detail within them.The Sound/music performance seems to be a mixed response as the dub is eventually interesting that the japanese version. The acting gave merit of brillance but through the course of the anime, some-to-most of the acting is recycle and used to be quite repeatable. While during the release of this and others cool anime, it wasn\\'t that quite of popular within Japan, hiring unknown voice actors to untalented ones but in truth, the quality of their voice work(in Trigun) seems to be alright. When the dub version of this anime was released, rivaling/on the same vein as Cowboy Bebop(hiring infamous voice actors, Steve Bloom and Wendee Lee), hiring now-known voice actor, Johnny Young Basoh. It seems to be quite interesting, making dubs towards this generation, more watchable than the original version.  While this didn\\'t hinder much of the reason of a perfect score. The Music direction under Yoko Inoue and Tsuneo Imahori proved to be quite a match between, Yoko Kanno performance of &quot;Tank&quot; and &quot;The Real Folk Blues&quot; making both of these anime very &quot;Cool&quot; and Amazing. It seems that Rock has given the result of a perfect score, having a creative opening with visual representation and a perfect choice for this song to have on a opening. As stated before, Vash\\'s characteristics in this anime has split personalities, either of which shows syphomy. Throughout Vash\\'s adventures with Wolfwood, Meryl and Milly, you get to know much of his personality and symphonized for it. Even though many is after his head, Vash shows symphony to others to help the best as he can through his adventures. He was known to wander from town-to-town as a wanderer(much like Kenshin) to try to have a peaceful living, spreading &quot;Love and Peace&quot; quotes, helping others, while giving people a better time. But since, Meryl and Milly was introduced, many took up arms to kill him and take the bounty awarded 6Billion dollars. Vash seems to struggle and standup even those whom betrayed or kill him and yet still shows symphony and as generous as he can. Getting criticize for this speculatated rumor/belief that Vash leads a gang or a utmost terrorist and terrified to even be with him. His life seems to be much as miserable as well as those of the antogonists, getting to have prejudice from people and arrogance as others: either threatened, beaten upon, close to death and more terrorising things that they despise upon. To be honest, Trigun seems to have more of sad story as problems torment Vash, each and everyday, deceit and contradiction, speculating from others to have his head. While Meryl and Milly creating attention to the public, and Vash unable to be alone as he doesn\\'t want to be alone but has too. Through the course of the anime, his friends and memories proceeded upon him, creating more torment and suffering to Vash. Until meeting, his opponents, they are even more cruel as they knew, Vash\\'s weakness and the value of humankind cannot continue to come to him. Even with his lost-to-regain of his lost memory, Vash still values and shows symphony making them feel great and having a great time. Its like a walking contradiction. This anime seems to be yet sad but others criticize this as a lesser dramatic show, while other anime shows shows a lack of reasoning, more of a cliche, uninteresting to unpresidented quality of Drama. Making some-to-most anime drama, more of a cliche than others. This feels like a slice of life, as a veteran of reallife wars could respect, knowing that you will get amounts of prejudice, judgement and suffering at war. Wanting to stop killing others as they are valuable and isn\\'t &quot;entertainment or fun&quot; to kill them. Its the symphony of the anime that is remisicent of wars like WWII, or even the Vietnam War, when veterans returning home but was greet with disrespect, prejudice and contradictions. Regretting on every lives, they killed in the war, on a verge of insanity or scarred to do so. You may think that its cool to be in a war or getting criminalized for something you didn\\'t do/couldn\\'t remember but in truth, its cruel and brutal to experience a death of the lives of the living. Overall, Trigun seems to be underrated to the fact that Cowboy Bebop is on the same vein as this. With a intriuging storyline, character development to the performances of a &quot;Rocking soundtrack&quot; and a representation of Western music similar to Cowboy Bebop. Trigun proceeds to be quite an awesome anime to those to enjoy. Much like Renshin and Spiegel, Vash shows some-most personalities, creating a fun-loving character to enjoy. And also Wolfwood\\'s outfit and some charcteristics are similar to Spike Spiegel, wearing the similar outfit(same colour, but with only some differences) and smoking a bent cigarette as both of them has. And to Legato and Wolfwood, I\\'m sadened to these whom have fallen, I simply showed emotion towards them as they were quite fanastic characters to enjoy through the course of the anime. To be honest, Legato seems to have the better power than others in anime out there, he doesn\\'t have to write on the notebook and use his Geass to control others, to kill someone. Its like his mind is doing it, unlike the Geass where you need to face infront of the person you are targeting or searching names to write on some notebook to kill someone. No. This seems to be more interesting than those.        10                              At first I had my doubts about this show. I held off on watching it until one of my best friends finally convinced me to watch it.Trigun starts off a little slow, and goes through a couple of filler episodes before the real show begins. The filler episodes in Trigun are more about character development and drawing character relationships rather than actual story. Trigun begins as a goofy comedy series that doesn\\'t seem to take itself seriously. Halfway through, though, Trigun truly becomes an epic and memorable masterpiece with an extremely intense climax.The art in Trigun is obviously outdated since this show was created in                  1998, yet the art is better than most anime shows at the time. The voice acting is also well done. I watched the English dub instead of the original Japanese voices, so I can\\'t really compare them. I love Vash\\'s voice, it\\'s the same guy who did the voice of Lelouch Lamperouge from Code Geass!! Other character\\'s voices are pretty memorable such as Milly\\'s voice. The soundtrack is pretty decent as well, although not memorable.The characters are one of the best elements of Trigun. Vash the Stampede, a legendary rouge with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head, is extremely fleshed out in this show. All the characters seem to have great chemistry with each other. A lot of the character in Trigun have made a lasting impression on me. Vash the Stampede is the childlike innocent badass, kind of like Goku, who possesses enormous strength. Milly is the strong, yet stupid and hilarious character who lacks common sense. Although Wolfwood is a secondary character to Vash, he is still a pretty damn interesting one. The Gung-Ho Gungs are one of the best and first rate criminal organizations featured in an anime. Legato Bluesummers, the unrelenting badass, Knives, an intelligent egocentric psychopath who is the brains behind the organization, and the Sniper. These are some of the more memorable chacaters of the show.Overall, I had a great time watching this show and I highly recommend it to everyone!                              It\\'s amazing how you can have pre-conceived notions of what something is going to be like only to have them completely ripped apart by actually checking it out for yourself. It looked like a boneheaded, action series with little to offer besides extended & noisy gunfights on the admittedly stylish surface but underneath there was real substance and heart (to go with the comedy, action and gunplay on top!)There\\'s a fair amount of filler episodes that don\\'t really seem to lead anywhere and the real meat on the plot doesn\\'t really start to surface until around the 12th episode but it remains funny & entertaining                  throughout. The characters are all fleshed out and likeable, the villains are proper characters with depth (in most cases) and towards the end the tone changes to a more tragic, dark, and philosophical shade without ever really losing it\\'s light touch. Perhaps most suprisingly it also manages to be profoundly human at times too.The main protagonist, Vash, lives strictly as a pacifist but his idealism is constantly tested and questioned. How is it possible to live this way in such a violent world? What happens when you\\'re faced with having to kill an \"enemy\" to save someone you love? Is it possible to save absolutely everybody? As one of his less idealistic companions comments, \"we\\'re nothing like God. Not only do we have limited powers, but sometimes we\\'re driven to become the devil himself\". Is sometimes the best choice we have on offer the lesser of two evils? Of course a definitive answer is never given but such questions are dealt with in a mature manner and it\\'s made clear throughout that not only are we able to make our own choices but we must also live with the consequences. The excuse of being forced into abandoning idealism because of circumstance is often a hollow one. At its heart this is what Trigun is all about. The decisions we make and how we cope with the fallout. More often than not there is always another route we can take and our hand is rarely forced.Trigun is definitely a strange show and one that turns words into ashes in your mouth when attempting to describe it to someone with no prior knowledge of the series. It\\'s definitely not meant to be an accurate depiction of reality yet you can\\'t help but get sucked into it\\'s crazy universe and once you do there\\'s some great storytelling underneath it all. Plus having an ultimate gun toting badass with a catchphrase \"love & peace\" is always a winner!        9                              \"There is something you can’t give up. There is something you want to protect. There is a time you must take a stand no matter what kind of pain awaits us. The man in the red coat took up his gun once again, in order to stop the sadness, in order to stop the hate. I keep the word of the red geranium which I was taught so long ago. I keep the courage and determination, deep in my heart. \"FANBOY ALERT !Well, I\\'ve been living for 20 years so WHY HAVEN\\'T I SEEN THIS BEFORE ! alright people this series just puts a spontaneous                  smile on my face, because it pretty much has it all. Vash the stampede , who is this man , or rather WHAT is this man . You are introduced to a simple , peace-loving , somewhat clumsy Vash the stampede, a Well-known \" Criminal \".  As a sequence of events follow, the series gets a bit darker, still having it\\'s moments of occasional humor .Meryl, Milly and Wolfwood . These characters and the way they\\'ve all interacted with each other and Vash, Friendship, humor, love, action; it\\'s all there. Further more, there are other characters like Legato and Knives who seem to enjoy the suffering of Vash as he faces his ultimate fear, the death of people around him. Who are these people ?One last remarkable character is Ren, a sacred part of Vash\\'s past which he seems to be overly-attached to.  In addition i absolutely love the character design. This is a 1998 anime, it has that bebop feel, the jazzy influence, that Rock \\'n\\' roll excitement at some occasions. The music just hits the spot !Most importantly the theme or rather the purpose of this anime is the true message it conveys. A true treasure that humanity has failed to seize even up till now.  Life is our treasure as humans, and mistakes are made for us to learn from them and fix our pasts, ultimately paving the way for a better future. I found this anime brilliant because it displays this simple message in such a brilliant way, and Vash is truly a lovable MC .\"Knives: You\\'re not a human being. You\\'re a plant.Vash: I know that.Knives: You\\'re a superior being.Vash: I disagree.\"Remember Kids...Love & Peace, Love & Peace !!!!        1                              \"Never look a gift horse in the mouth\"Vash the coolest anime character history... shaved himself to death.All of the guys he encountered which he tried to make deep physical contact withshot themselves to death.The final episode masterpieceepic showdownand suddenly recapping the whole storyWhat for did we watch the episodes beforewhen the whole story is in the final episodeAt least we got to see the outstanding art of Trigun (1998) and the lovely moe chara Millly HorseGunslingers are not meant to be using supernovasThe power of friendships and believing prevailsNot killing people is so cool\"No one is allowed to take a life\",says the artificial humanoid weaponarmed                  with tears.Biggest ending twist in the history of anime, all those wet clothes.How could they shoot all those children,priest, you love childrendrown in childrenin the orphanageThe priest being the best girl was trying hard to save this apocalyptic masterpiece.But everyone knows that best girls don\\'t get their way.        0                              This is on my list of shows I show to those new to Anime.  It utilizes several character archetypes that are unfamiliar (and can at first be jarring) to those accustomed to the storytelling language used in the West.  Characters that at first seem to be very one dimensional and goofy eventually reveal hidden depths leading to some of the most moving and affecting moments in the genre.  If you are new to the medium this is a very gentile introduction to some of the more outlandish elements of Anime here present in their most palatable forms.  Don\\'t give up on                  it before the halfway point, there is a hell of a tonal shift.  Keep going and it will be well worth it.                                      Trigun is probably my #2 Anime barely behind cowboy bebop the story is great but it can feel at times to be off track though I don\\'t wholly mind in this case due to the setting and the characters. the art does seem a bit dated with some low points in almost every episode but at times it can be quite nice and truly pull you in. the music is good at capturing the feeling of the show and the dub is excellent. the characters are great and I honestly felt bad for the bad guys at times understanding where they came from. overall I                  enjoyed the show and would recommend anyone to watch it in the dub.        t10                              Trigun is a classic.  You should watch it just because of this fact.  Now, time for the actual review.  The story is great.  It has a sci-fi/western setting that works so well with the feel of the show.  Now, this benefits me especially since I am a huge lover of sci-fi.  The ending isn\\'t as good as it could have been, but it wraps everything up nicely enough.  The art is nothing special nowadays.  In fact, analyzing it from the perspective of an anime watcher in 2015, the art is kind of a let down.  But                  you have to consider how old it is.  That makes me want to give it an 8 or 9 out of 10 for the art, but then I compare it to Cowboy Bebop which was released extremely close to Trigun, and Trigun just can\\'t match up.  That is why it earns a 7, for being great, but it doesn\\'t hold up as well as other shows from its time.  The sound is also good.  I mean, there weren\\'t many jump-out tracks in Trigun besides the opening (which is the definition of badass, by the way) but what was there fit the show quite well.  As for the characters, I love them.  This show has two of my favorite anime characters of all time, the two being our main protagonist, Vash the Stampede, and traveling priest Nicholas D Wolfwood.  Vash is hilarious while at the same time managing to have a deep moral struggle throughout the show, something that adds a lot of depth to his character.  Wolfwood also has a struggle with morality which allows him more character depth as well.  My enjoyment was thorough and complete with a lot of laughing and even some crying at a certain scene (trust me, you\\'ll know which one).  Despite the small flaws it has in its art and the minimal story issues, it is still one of my favorite anime of all time.  Thus, it earns a 10/10.        ent10                              Lemme tell you why you should watch Trigun:CatsBOOM. Now go watch it.I apologize, but I really have to indulge myself a wee bit when I partake in this writing-jane-doe-thinks-her-opinions-are-warranted fest thing.Trigun is a title that will consistently appear on lists of top 90s anime, and with good reason! The soundtrack alone made me weak in the knees, and that was before I even had one eighth of an inkling as to what was going on. The show is set on an Old West themed, arid, harsh planet, and follows the story of Vash the Stampede (infamous gunslinger outlaw with a mysterious past) and the various                  friends he makes along the way. Two of his companions actually work for an insurance company that is trying to cut costs down by preventing Vash from causing anymore destruction, as nearly every town he passes through ends up being utterly totaled.Naturally, this anime has palpable similarities with Cowboy Bebop: from the inhumanly skilled but laid back main character to the interesting supporting cast, fans of both series will find themselves drawing parallels between the two, and that\\'s a good thing! Something Trigun provides that is unique from Bebop is that, by the end of the series, significantly more questions are answered. Not all of them, mind you, but just enough that any viewer can walk away satisfied but still speculating on what could have happened in this universe.Some wonderful and refreshing news pertaining to Trigun is that it is light on the commonly exaggerated anime character tropes.Yes, the side characters can be silly, but I rarely had to suspend all disbelief in order to take particular characters seriously. In fact, the more fleshed out Vash the Stampede becomes, the less you question whatever stereotypes he may fall into. I briefly mentioned the soundtrack earlier and I\\'m 100000% positive it\\'s worth discussing again: fucking gorgeous and insanely badass! I haven\\'t heard guitar riffs this insanely catchy in a very long time, and one particular song had me whistling for days after I finished the show in its entirety. Trigun is an upbeat adventure, a hilarious comedy, and a stirring drama. Definitely worth checking out.ment10                              Amazing show. Its badass and funny at the same time. The four main characters are all great, and it stays very entertaining throughout the entire series. I never got bored once. Awesome story, and it has it has good morals too. If you enjoyed Cowboy Bebop then you definitely need to watch Trigun. nt10                              Tri gun is an amazing anime its a true piece of art the story is really played out and what i mean by that is its not an original story but the characters are hilarious and the story really goes into depth with them. The action is amazing and the combat is nicley done tri gun is a must see.                               Trigun is considered a classic, and I could certainly see why. The characters are presented well and the story runs smoothly. It really achieves the steampunk western feel it is shooting for. And for what it is worth, Trigun is a good show. It is only brought down by my tastes in that I don\\'t really enjoy westerns and it was a bit too episodic in the beginning for me. It is also brought down for the art, as a reboot would make this at least a 7 for me. But if you enjoy the theme than I have no doubt you would enjoy the                  show, because Trigun embodies it very well. For me this show had a somewhat similar feel to Cowboy Bebop although the settings are different and Bebop was more episodic.                                       Trigun Review (MINOR SPOILERS)There\\'s a certain anime reviewer on YouTube who I VERY much enjoy their work. Their reviews are always super informative, entertaining, and he\\'s helped me find some of my absolute favorite shows of all time. This reviewer is known for making a certain list known as \"The 5 Anime Series Everyone Should Watch Before You Die\". Those 5 would be Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Evangelion, Fullmetal Alchemist, and Akira. I just finished watching Trigun, and now Akira is the last thing on that list that I\\'ve yet to see. This list has definitely been interesting. As Bebop and FMA have easily become some                  of my favorite anime series of all time. While on the other hand, Evangelion is one of my least favorite anime of all time. Though, I\\'m sure I\\'m not the first person you\\'ve heard say that. But we\\'re not here to talk about those shows We\\'re here to talk about Trigun and where it falls on that list of the holy quintet of anime necessities.Trigun looked very similar to Bebop, when I was previewing images and quick glimpses of footage, before watching. Both were made in the same year, both involve bounty hunting, and both have very similar settings. So since I was such a huge fan of Bebop and the awesome Chuck Norris-ness that was its main cast of characters, I was expecting the same from Trigun. Did I end up getting that? Well...... kinda, but not really. The first thing that became VERY apparent to me in the first episode is that our main protagonist, Vash, is a GIANT WEENY. Vash, AKA THE HUMANOID TYPHOON WITH A SIXTY MILLION DOUBLE DOLLAR BOUNTY, VASH THE STAMPEDE (ya, you\\'re gonna hear that A LOT in this show) is known all over the land as being this monstrous human weapon of mass destruction, but in reality, he\\'s both a complete pacifist and the most hyper active crybaby in the entire show. Now don\\'t get me wrong. I can totally respect a person who refuses to kill or fight, and stands up against violence. I\\'m one of those people, myself. But I feel they could\\'ve at least made him cool about being a pacifist who manages to always come out on top. Most of the time, it seems like a complete accident that he even survived, and he just sorta ends up being the one given credit for saving everyone. Now this becomes a lot less apparent, later on in the show. Ash does end up growing a backbone during certain situations, as well as having a cool and cocky confident side that\\'s fun to watch, when it shows up. But a LOT of the times, he\\'s stuck in wiener mode, and it\\'s just not fun to watch.The other main characters include Meryl and Milly, who \"accompany\" Vash on his adventures. They\\'re fun characters in their own way. I\\'m glad that Meryl wasn\\'t a typical ball of anger character. Though, she can still be a bit stubborn and ignorant at times, which can get a bit old. Milly acts as her anchor and is the carefree one of the group. And finally there\\'s Mr. Wolfwood, who is basically Vash without the wiener attributes. The two end up conflicting with one another due to their different views on the battlefield, but also end up being a pretty awesome team. The rest of the characters range from mysterious bad guys who slowly get revealed as the show goes on, to simple minor characters who are only important for the one episode that they appear in. Something I liked a lot about Bebop is that it made each individual episode\\'s story feel REALLY important. Each episode seemed long and you grew attached to the minor characters and their stories, even though you\\'d never see them after that one episode. Trigun is very similar in its set up, but doesn\\'t nearly succeed as much as Bebop did. The first 5 episodes of Trigun are more or less the same exact thing. Vash getting roped into some sort of trouble, some bad guys doing bad things, good guys turning out to be bad, bad guys turning out to be good, Vash stopping all of them from fighting, and keeps everyone from dying, and Meryl refusing to believe that Vash is actually Vash.It isn\\'t until Episode 6 where things start becoming somewhat interesting. You begin to receive pieces of a mystery. You see that there\\'s more to Vash\\'s character then meets the eye. You get more and more pieces to the puzzle as time goes on, but there are still instances where they bring back those boring filler episodes that are exactly like episodes 1-5. Not only that, but there\\'s a flashback episode thrown into the halfway point, too! If the mystery weren\\'t so interesting, I might\\'ve given up on the show, for making me trek through so many slow parts. In the end, am I happy with all that was revealed? Yes, actually. This show actually gets pretty incredible, during the second half. It\\'s just annoying to wait so long to get there. But once you\\'re there, you\\'ll never wanna stop moving. Probably the most interesting thing about Trigun is that it isn\\'t afraid to rip its main protagonist to shreds. And whenever those moments arise, where Vash\\'s world is quickly falling apart, seeing his reactions to it all is just really interesting to watch. Not in a mean way, but in, it keeps you wondering how he\\'ll recover from this, or if he\\'ll even want to. The other characters go through the same kind of trauma, after facing all the garbage that\\'s thrown at them, and I\\'m glad that all of them were really involved, in the end of it all.Now let\\'s move onto animation. Let\\'s be real, here. This show is from 1998. It ain\\'t gonna look good, compared to today\\'s stuff. For it\\'s time, I guess it\\'s ok looking. But like many other shows from back then, Trigun\\'s visuals do not age well. However, I don\\'t really feel like a show like this needs to look good. They\\'re in the wild west (sorta). Stuff is dirty and gritty there. The dry and plain wasteland, along with the dirty looking people, all just fit into that environment. It reminds you of a real old western tv series or movie. Now I\\'m sure this wasn\\'t intentional on the animators part, as I\\'m sure this was the best kind of quality they could come up with, during that era. But it simply doesn\\'t hurt the show, looking like this. Ya, it\\'s old. But it\\'s not bad enough to the point where you can\\'t bare to even look at it. Honestly, there have only been two anime series that had visuals so unappealing to me, that it was painful to watch. One of them I finished, only because it was a 3 episode series, while the other one... I\\'m not gonna name, because I\\'m sure I\\'ll receive a lot of hate from people, once they know what it is.As for the music, while the western setting is very heavily apparent, it mixes that with a futuristic vibe, as well. As such, the music is not some little ukulele diddy played by old man Jenkins, but rather a bunch of awesome electric guitar tracks. it suits the show\\'s fight scenes VERY well, and the opening does a good job at getting you pumped up for the show... even if the episode might end up not being as awesome as the opening was. As far as the voice cast goes, both the Japanese and English versions sound very identical to me. My main gripe with the show is with Vash\\'s voice actor. It takes some getting used to. While he does portray the weeny side of Vash very well, I wish that when the moments of epic awesomeness arise, where Vash is actually brave and somewhat terrifying, that he actually had a voice to match. But instead, he sounds like a poor man\\'s version of a generic superhero from a children\\'s Saturday morning cartoon show. The other voice actors do their jobs alright, though there are several instances where the line delivery, mouth flaps, and overall script just seems off. I get that it\\'s old, but other shows from this era had no problem with just overall sentence structuring, so why this one?Now there is a movie to go along with this series, made 12 years after the original series began. Now I don\\'t think I\\'ll bother making a full blown review of the movie Badlands Rumble, so I\\'ll just briefly state my thoughts on it, here. It\\'s basically a movie length episode, that takes place sometime in the middle of the series. The events in the movie are never mentioned in the series, so just watch this if you really wanna watch some more Trigun. Though, be forewarned. In the English dub of the Trigun movie, Vash is the ONLY character to retain his original voice actor. Meryl, Milly, and Wolfwood all have different voice actors for this movie, due to various reasons on their voice actors\\' side of things. Now while their replacements didn\\'t do a bad job, it\\'s just VERY noticeable that the voices are different. So maybe watch this movie after some time has passed from watching the series. The movie isn\\'t necessary to the series, like I said, but it\\'s still a lot more enjoyable than most of the filler episodes were. Plus, the 12 years that have passed since the original series give this movie a MAJOR upgrade in visuals. The movie is gorgeous, and is worth watching, simply to see familiar faces in a MUCH nicer light!Overall, Trigun was not nearly as amazing as I thought it was going to be. I highly recommend Cowboy Bebop over this show, any day. But I certainly didn\\'t hate this show, by any means. It has its serious moments and a story that really draws you in. The only problem is that there are several times where it\\'s just not progressing. I was a bit torn on what I wanted to rate this show. Part of me really don\\'t think it\\'s deserving of that high of a score, but another part of me knows that other people will enjoy this show much more than I did. Plus, compared to many other shows I\\'ve seen that have no redeeming qualities int he end, Trigun definitely is not one of those shows. When all is said and done, I\\'m glad I took this adventure. Though I might not take it again, I\\'m glad that I did, at all. As well as what I\\'ve learned from it.Trigun gets a 7/10        10                              Trigun, on the surface is a tale about a man named Vash the Stampede who is a goofy gunslinger and wanders from town to town on a futuristic, yet run-down dust ball planet, in order to find a place where he can belong to, while encountering hardships along the way.  When in reality, Trigun is a beautiful story of redemption, internal struggle, and always standing for what you believe in even when it is inconvenient.  Throughout the course of the story, Vash is faced with nearly overwhelming hardships, yet he never compromises on his beliefs. You are constantly on the edge of your                  seat wondering, \"How the HECK is he gonna get out of this one?!\" and there is a sort of unpredictability that is rarely felt in most fights.  On the surface it appears that Vash\\'s goal is to discover more about his past, when in reality, his is searching for a form of redemption to make up for all the people that he has killed in the past, as well as simply finding a place where he can belong, help people, and live the rest of his life in peace and joy; though there are always villains who wish to interrupt that peace in order to gain the title of \"the person who defeated Vash the Stampede\" the world\\'s first and only human natural disaster, as well as gain the $$60,000,000,000 reward that goes along with it.  Trigun also does an excellent job in rationing the explanation and answers to the questions that develop in your mind as you\\'re watching.  There is always a sort of mystery about things and you never feel as though you are receiving \"the whole truth\".  In this way, it keeps you especially interested whenever a flashback is shown or when anyone is speaking about why something is the way that it is.  You also always have this feeling that there is always something to look forward to so that you can receive \"the whole truth\" of the matter.  It also has some of the strongest feelings of both joy and sadness that I\\'ve felt when watching anything.  Wonderful story!Nearly every character in Trigun is interesting in their own way and feel very human; which allows you to feel a sort of unique connection with most them that you wouldn’t normally experience in an anime.  Even if a character is minor, you still care about what happens to them and you are at least somewhat interested in their past.  Trigun also possesses not one, but two of what I consider to be some of the greatest villains in anime history and all condensed within only 26 episodes.  How many anime can say that?  First, we have who I consider to be the better of the two villains, Legato Bluesummers.  Legato Bluesummers is the leader of the Gung-Ho-Guns and is more than capable of killing Vash at any given time.  But he doesn\\'t.  Why?  Because Legato understands that Vash would rather die than take the life of another, he doesn\\'t attack Vash\\'s body, he attacks his spirit.  He forces him to choose between the lives of his friends and maintaining the stability of what he believes in.  The entire elaborate plan, along with the fact that all he wants in life is to make Vash\\'s pain as severe as possible makes him in my opinion, one of the most sinister and diabolical villains in anime. I won\\'t spoil what ends up happening, but it is one of the very most intense scenes that I have ever witnessed.  Then we have both Legato\\'s master and Vash\\'s brother, Millions Knives.  Now Knives, in contrast, has given up on attacking Vash\\'s spirit.  He realizes after several attempts that Vash will no change his views on the human race and will never join him.  So Knives attacks Vash\\'s body in the present and does everything in his power to kill him.  By doing this, Legato and Knives create an insidious duel villain set unlike any other that I\\'ve seen previous, or since.  Another amazing character is Nicholas D. Wolfwood.  I can\\'t say too much about him without spoiling anything, but he has a very real, yet mysterious feel to him and is just an all around bad ass.  In a world where most people wear cowboy attire and are either unarmed or have a cowboy pistol, this guy wears a sleek suite, shades, and carries around a giant chrome cross that shoots automatic rounds and RPGS.  Come on.  The only thing that detracts from the characters somewhat is a lack of a quality back story for some of the more major characters such as Legato Bluesummers and the Gung-Ho-Guns.  But that aside from that and a few other ambiguities, they are nearly flawless.While the quality of animation and art leaves much to be desired, it more than makes up for it in terms of sound.  The voice cast for Trigun is pretty solid and nearly all the voices match their characters personas quite well.  But what are even more impressive than that are the soundtrack and sound effects.  The soundtrack or lack thereof ALWAYS adds to what\\'s taking place at the time and the sound effects sound real as though the scene is taking place right before your eyes.Overall, Trigun is one of the best anime out there in my opinion.  One thing that I also find fascinating is there are many contradictions and are combined into one that exist within the anime.  Anything from the fact that the planet is quite futuristic, yet anything from the way people dress, to the architecture, to even the way people go about things is very primitive.  Wolfwood is both a priest, yet a gunslinger.  Vash is a jolly womanizer with a heart of gold, while at other times he is as serious as can be and turns into someone you would not want to face in a million years.  Just something I thought was worth mentioning.  Now, the primary complaint that I hear about Trigun is that it feels too \"episodic\" in the first half or that there\\'s no story until towards the end of the series.  And though I can sympathize with those who say that a few of the first episodes do seem somewhat episodic, and somewhat unimportant in the grand scheme of the story itself, I do believe that almost all of them are necessary for the full understanding of the what characters are actually willing to do in certain situations or how much they can endure as an individual.  I also believe that part of the problem is that some people go into it thinking that because it has guns, that its merit will be found in action.  And though Trigun does offer some good action, it\\'s not great by any means.  The people that really like it for what it is possess a full understanding and appreciation all of the unique, deep, and meaningful themes, motifs, symbolism, and characterization and can really relish the depth that can be found in these notions, because they are willing to peel away all of the layers that go with them.  Due to Trigun’s  occasional ups and downs and its few other weaknesses, it is prevented from receiving a 10/10 from me, however I do have a great love for this anime and it will always hold a special place on my list.  This anime isn\\'t just good, it\\'s fantastic.ment10                              Trigun is a must see for anyone who is a fan of anime or animation in general. It is one of the most beautifully animated shows I\\'ve ever seen. Along with it\\'s animation Trigun brings probably two of the best protagonists that have ever been on TV: Vash and Wolfwood.  Both of these characters have many different layers to their personalities that make them diverse and a tad unpredictable at times.  They\\'re not very predictable characters which is a rarity in this day and age.Trigun is definitely in my top three favorite animes, the other two being Mobile Suit Gundam Wing and Cowboy                  Bebop, and I would recommend it to anyone.        nt8                              Wow. Wow wow wow wow wow. This show has got to be one of the coolest animes I have ever seen.Story:  This story was so compelling. I was interested the entire way through. Seeing as there are only 26 episodes, there was obviously going to be some places that could have been developed further - sure. But the plot they present and care out is so well done and interesting that it just makes me wish for more seasons. Art: Alright, some people say 90\\'s anime art is not that awesome but I totally disagree. I like the thin, \\'scratchier\\' lines and gruffer design.                  The style of the art really suits the whole feel of the show. I think they did a  great job with keeping it consistent with the manga artwork. Sound: HOLY MUFFINS! The music in the show was perfect. PERFECT. It suited the style and feel of the show in its entirety. Actually, the music is part of the reason I actually decided to watch this. I was on the fence when I started the first episode. But as soon as I heard that opening guitar riff, I was all \" HELLLLLZZZ YEAH\"Characters: Vash has to be the coolest character to ever be created in the history of ever. Seriously, he is such a dynamic, complex character that he basically makes the show. This show should be \"VASH and co\" because, let\\'s be real, you watch for Vash. He is the most endearing badass I have ever seen. Ok ok, the other characters were great too. I loved Wolfwood. I liked him almost as much as I liked Vash. And Millie and Meryle surprised me. They could be a little annoying but I liked that they actually had distinctive and unique personalities. Enjoyment: I gave this an 8 because, while I love the show, I definitely had to watch it in small intervals. I\\'m not sure why. But I think that after watching a bunch of episodes in a row, the uniqueness wears off. Overall: Definitely watch it. Its a classic for a reason, you know! Everything was top-notch - even the dubbing ( I rarely watch anime in English dub because...well, it\\'s normally just so bad that its kinda painful)! But there are a few dubbed gems out there and Trigun is one of them!                                       I\\'m no expert so i won\\'t meld with technical details you can google the plot and stuff so you won\\'t read them here either so we go straight to my opinion about this anime.first with the charactersTrigun could have been a great series, the characters especially the lead Vash the stampede is very promising at the beginning. He is a peacemaker that does not resolve to violence despite being a legendary gunman. Not finishing enemies off is not necessarily a bad thing, we have seen this in other series and more often than not, executed properly. That is not the case in Trigun, the main                  characters purpose of \"saving other people\" is a complete failure having killed more innocent bystanders because he can\\'t at least disable the bad guy before turning his back from fights. Vash\\'s supposed strength is overshadowed by senseless deaths of people around him because of his lack of resolve and sense of purpose.Another disappointing character is Wolfwood, what happened to him is just plain dumb. The supposed love interest Meryl is not interesting at all. Her relation with Vash is far from what you may really call romantic. then there\\'s Milly, well, she\\'s interesting, that\\'s all there is to say. Lastly, the main antagonist Knives, He just popped out of nowhere just in time to lose.Not only your respect for the characters but also your interest in the story degrades with each episode. Until halfway they are helping random people from random towns and then suddenly some bad guys wants to kill good ol Vash, but wait, I can\\'t shoot them because it\\'s wrong to kill, better get other people around me get killed instead. Because of these stupid events, I started not to care what will happen to these characters, I just bared with it until the end to see if the ending would be any good. Well no.The conclusion just got there, here\\'s the bad guy, defeat him BANG! the end. not at all exciting.It\\'s not at all a bad anime neither it is a master piece some people make it out to be. Watching this is fun at the start and at the end.... MEH.                                      At first glance Trigun can seem like a very one dimensional and cliched series. Look a little deeper and you\\'ll find an underrated gem of an anime. One that breaks the standard cliche of the unflappable hero, and creates a narrative that draws you along without letting go.Trigun\\'s quality hinges on its powerful story, it\\'s what validates the weaker elements. Art is solid but nothing special, the voice acting is hit and miss depending on the character and the soundtrack is atmospheric, lending a unique sound to every situation.Ultimately, it\\'s the characters of Trigun that will resonate with you the most. Yasuhiro Nightow\\'s cast all                  have their place but in the end Vash is the star, his personality is built up so well that by the time the pivotal moment in his character development arrives, you\\'ll find yourself deeply moved by his decision.Everything about Trigun is pure entertainment, it has that bit more for those who want something morally challenging, but it is a series that is more than the sum of its parts. A show that starts off as over the top, goofy action but slowly evolves into a wonderfully deep and poignant series.                                      This anime became one of my favourite due to the great emotional impact it left on me. The review will be short. I\\'ll make some points of why I liked this series, that others seemingly haven\\'t mentioned it yet. No need for writing the short summary, I guess.As for someone who is fond of western landscapes, deserts and the lonely atmosphere, I think the setting was the cat\\'s whisker. Someone might not find it interesting, just a sandy planet with a few towns. Sounds boring? It\\'s actually what had drawn me into the series, it\\'s simple yet creates a melancholic and nostalgic feel. When combined                  with some powerful sad scene, I simply can\\'t help myself, I\\'m utterly smitten Characters are great, both the protagonists and antagonists  (no need to say more about the comedy either, other reviewers did the rest well) The action is, what I was dissapointed with, in the series. It varies throughout the anime, but majority of the sequences are sucky, sometimes there\\'s no coreography at all. The last battle was brilliant, although I feel they could made it still better. Characters, amazing music and the atmosphere of the environment is what made me cry. The animation is old school but average even for its time. But I have no problem with it, since I like older animes.The story is quite good and I\\'d say it is pretty unique  had I seen it before Monster (there are quite some similarities between the two). Sorry if I\\'m being an ass for this.Overall, Trigun is a great anime with balance. It known when it should turn into comedy and when to become extremely serious.                                       Warning possible SpoilersAh the 90\\'s a time when anime wasn\\'t that big of a thing and during that time we got some pretty good classic\\'s like Cowboy Bebop, Dragonball, Pokemon and Trigun an anime stretching for Love and Peace.The story is set on another world many years into the future where the human race has to survive an almost inhospitable environment full of dangerous weather and dangerous criminals, in comes Vash the Stampede a man with a $$60,000,000,000 bounty on his head yet all he wants is to spread Love and Peace.For a story this was actually pretty good despite starting off slow with some                  filler like episodes to get you used to the characters once you approach the halfway point the situation goes from random comedic gunfights with Vash messing around and into more serious territory as we find out more about Vash\\'s past and why these super powered villains are coming after him, honestly the story gets sadder and sadder every episode until the final showdown happens although I would\\'ve liked a bit more closure in the ending, but at least it didn\\'t do a Cowboy Bebop and gathering from the credit\\'s I can kinda guess what happens afterwards.It was very interesting seeing how Vash goes the way he does which is by not killing anyone even if they are trying to kill him because he thinks all life is precious and that nobody has the right to take a life even if they are a bad person so seeing people die hurts Vash and makes him feel like they died because of him which over time doe make him more conflicted with his actions and moral code plus the more the story progresses the more he realises that his way can\\'t always win and that it is sometimes inevitable to not kill somebody in a battle, though of course it is funny seeing Vash\\'s random attics cause trouble for everybody and even his friends who do eventually get used to it sadly though his random attics do tend to leave a considerable amount of damage to everyone\\'s homes hence why he tries to be careful when he ends up in firefights.Now the characters were actually great, I didn\\'t find one that annoyed me and they were a funny bunch too, even the villains were pretty good and it\\'s difficult finding decent villains.Vash is the MC and in my eyes his character feels like a non-vulgar Deadpool badass yet can be very stupid sometimes yet Vash can also be a very deep person often thinking that whenever someone dies in a battle he blames himself because if he hadn\\'t appeared that person would still be alive and you see his character deteriorate overtime as more people die from his actions making him a character you feel sorry and really just want him to spread his message of Love & Peace.Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson are the main female duo of this show and are two co-workers sent by the Bernardelli Insurance Society to evaluate claims regarding Vash, both of these characters are very different Meryl is more short tempered and doesn\\'t put up with Vash\\'s attics which usually end with her punching him, at first she didn\\'t believe Vash was the legend he was because of his personality however overtime from seeing Vash\\'s actions she begins to believe and becomes more mellow with him even forming feelings for him as she felt sorry for the pain he was going though at later points in the show.Milly on the other hand is much more different she is a simple and ditzy yet is very kind hearted and is usually very optimistic however everyone normally calls her a weirdo or sweet idiot mainly because she can cause her own troubles much like Vash, although she can be tough especially thanks to her tall, strong figure and she doesn\\'t go anywhere without her patented Stun Gun.Nicholas D Wolfwood is a wandering priest that Vash, Meryl and Milly find in the desert, however he isn\\'t your usual priest as the giant cross he carries houses a nice select of weapons, Wolfwood is a man of God and has a firm belief in martialism so his moral code often comes into conflict with Vash\\'s yet the two do get on very well despite Wolfwood being more serious he can be a funny fellow from time to time and   gets on well with the girls especially Milly, he eventually does agree with Vash\\'s way of thinking however this did cost him in a battle with his mentor.Knives is the brother of Vash and unlike Vash he hates humanity as the two of them aren\\'t actually human, Vash cares deeply for Humanities well being while Knives thinks they are parasites and need to be eradicated even if that means using super powered henchman to do his bidding, you see the conflict between the brothers as their way of life is much different while Knives thinks he\\'s superior to humans Vash thinks he isn\\'t.Legato is the main henchman of Knives group known as the Gung-Ho Guns and he is a very emotionless and ruthless person who has the power to control people\\'s bodies thanks to having Vash\\'s left arm that was shot off by his brother, despite having this power though Legato hates himself and has been wishing to die ever since which eventually happens to him thanks to the forced action of Vash.The artstyle was actually very good I liked the style of the characters especially Vash and Wolfwood, Vash\\'s red coat definitely fits his character as a legendary gunman along with his stylish glasses and spiky hairstyle, Wolfwood looked surprisingly like Spike Spiegel from Cowboy Bebop which is probably where the inspiration for Spikes character and style came from. I also liked the way the world is set in a western themed world which is just constant desert and everyone wearing Cowboy hats and stuff like that which felt very fitting for the way the show is which also fitted the steampunk style of the many vehicles in this show too.I liked the op too the Rock metal music fitted with what\\'s in store with the viewer and makes you think that Vash really is a proper badass when he\\'s just a foolish badass plus the western themed soundtrack really did fit the setting however it just didn\\'t fit whenever a serious moment was happening at that point it just felt off.I really enjoyed the action as even though there are bullets flying everywhere just seeing Vash taking down enemies without needing to kill them is a very badass and heroic way of doing things, but that doesn\\'t mean the others don\\'t get a chance too since Wolfwood is a complete badass with his Punisher cross gun and is almost as good of a gunfighter as Vash is, hell even Meryl and Milly can hold their own that is if the opportunity arises because sometimes even when they have their guns they just surrender and give up which didn\\'t make any sense mostly.The comedy was also really good as Vash\\'s actions always caused problems for everyone yet out his ridiculous actions he always ends up saving the day however to Wolfwood, Meryl and Milly it does cause them many problems that makes it difficult for them to work with Vash, also Vash may be a legend he can be a bit of a weakling for women as almost every episode there is a female character introduced that sways Vash\\'s eyes however it doesn\\'t turn out good for him as he never really succeeds in getting a date.Overall this is a classic 90\\'s anime that is definitely great to watch, so if you\\'re a fan of westerns and stupid badass characters then you\\'ll find a good amount of enjoyment even if the story doesn\\'t kick in till the halfway point.        ment10                              NOTE: This is just my own uneducated, biased opinion its not fact so dont freak at me.Now what can be said about Trigun to get you to watch it if you haven\\'t already. I\\'m sure many people have since it\\'s obviously been around for a long time being from the 90\\'s and all, but that shouldnt be your only reason not to watch it. Just because its an older show does not put a damper on the quality of the series. Normally that is the go to complaint about older shows is the art quality, but sometimes a series is just so far ahead of                  its time, and that is the case for Trigun. The post-apocalyptic/desert setting and ominously placed monuments make for a edgy feel in this light hearted and fun anime. So Vash our main character is a bit of a womanizer, trouble maker, and man with a secret past which we slowly discover through the series. Most of his adventures are episodic in nature, but he is reunited with friendly faces along the way. The enitire cast of characters, from one shot villains, to reoccurring companions are so fleshed out and real that they all feel like their own person with dreams and heartache. The music is your typical amazing 90\\'s retro tracks full of eerie energy as Vash tears up a town while escaping the law, and knows when to cool down with those feely (it can be a word if I want it to) moments. This show has a bit for everyone and appeals to a wide range of audiences. While being a western it feels futuristic. And while being episodic, it carries a story rich enjoyment. And while being fun and childish, it can be brooding and mature. I truly enjoyed this series in so many ways that it cant be reasonably described in a review but this is a must watch for most anyone who can respect a good show when its made.                                      Trigun falls into the category that is shared by a few movies I\\'ve seen. This category is for things I\\'ve enjoyed greatly, but acknowledge aren\\'t in the top tier. For example, I enjoyed American Psycho much more than The Godfather, however I of course was forced to rate The Godfather more highly because I know it\\'s a better movie. This was true for Trigun as well and I enjoyed it more than most anime I\\'ve seen, most notably Death Note which I gave a perfect 10.Unlike my fellow colleagues in this club, I can\\'t ignore this enjoyment or \"rapeness\" factor. Therefore, I had to carefully                  consider this review in its entirety. Trigun is in episodic form and so the story can drag on or seem pointless at times. Towards the end though the story picks up and delivers.The characters are very good in my opionion. The main character, Vash the Stampede, is very likeable and the villians are perform very well in their roles.All this being said, the thing I liked most about this anime were its messages. The philosophies of Vash and Wolfwood offer a new look on life and are beyond intriguing.In summation, watch Trigun bitches.                                      Trigun is one man\\'s crusade for peace in a world afraid to trust. And also donuts.I think Vash is Kenshin in another life.  Although I\\'m not sure how realistic a peace-loving warrior is, I like the idea.  Wolfwood strikes me as the most developed character, and he works especially well in juxtaposition to Vash.  This anime always leaves me feeling like there\\'s something more to digest.I am convinced that Trigun draws at least partially from T. S. Eliot\\'s The Wasteland.  Despite hating both poem and poet, the similarity adds a whole other level of depth and meaning to the series.                   Both have themes of isolation, selfishness, drought, barrenness, lack of religion/morality, being in the wake of a crisis, and rain/finding water.The soundtrack also intrigues me.  Although Yoko Kanno was not involved, the guitarist  from the Seatbelts composed, and several other members played.   Although it has a more western/rugged sound throughout, the music really spans the emotional course from frightened and scared to stupidly happy.        ment10                              this anime is about  a guy named vash the stampede who try to bring love and peace thou out the world   hes one of the most likeable characters in anime history .storythe stroy is about this legendary gunslinger named vash the stampede  the story of vash make the strongest  of men tremble in fear of his name. and the story\\'s bro try him as a killer but hes axially a goofy guy who just wants to spread love and peace everywhere he gos. and i give the story a 10 out 0f10art.the art is very good for a anime from                  the 90s .sound .the sound of jhonny young bosch are great so is the cast of voice actors they all did a great job on this anime .Character.the characters are great and lovable you will like the adventures of vash Milly Meryl and wolf wood i did. and all four are very lovable i enjoyed the cast of characters. the cast and characters got a 10 out of10enjoyment i enjoyed this anime form beging to end  overallthis anime gets a perfect 10 out of 10                               I liked Trigun because it learned me something very important and very valuable: if you want to keep someone dear to you inside your soul, one possibility is to follow what they have teached you, but also to learn other people what you\\'d learned.Vash is trying Rem to keep alive in his soul. For Vash, Rem is like a mentor, more than that, she is the person that makes him continue his life. But, when Vash took someone\\'s life, breaking the teaches received from Rem, his world falls apart. In this moment happens the most beautiful scene from the anime: Vash discovers that he teached                  someone else Rem\\'s values in life and this gives his the power to fight against his greatest fears.         nt9                              What can I say? Trigun is a good anime. Not more from that.First, at the beginning, the anime was funny. Many scenes were such as a comedy: When someone was trying to kill Vash, in the end will discover that he shot on some thing.Second, the characters were great. I liked how Meryl, Milly and WolfWood were accompanied Vash all over his way and Vash himself was funny and cute and allways when he saved someone, he showed how he tries to be a hero, instead of a criminal who wanted on $6,000,000,000. And don\\'t forget the stuck cat, that was always has been pushed                  and says his funny \\'Meow\\'.Third, the animation wasn\\'t that good. Okay, the anime was made in the almost ending of 90\\'s, but still, the anime seems that it made in the ending of 80\\'s, because the anime remained me a little Dragon Ball Z for example.Forth, the soundtrack was in any right place and time. It remained me the wild west, the background of the series.Fifth, the second half of the series was very interesting and very sad. From this half, we aware to the violence and the sad moments of the series. But... the reason why am I let to Trigun 9 is because that the end was disappointed me. I won\\'t tell anything, but you should discover by yourself what am I mean.In any case, in briefly, the anime is good and if you will watch, you will enjoy! :)        ment10                              Action+Comedy+Incredible Characters+NO DAMN DRAMAIf your constantly finding yourself enjoying things like, Dexter (HBO), Elfen Lied (Anime), but hate the drama, love the action and humor?           This is the anime for you!This anime is HILLARIOUS.  I must say, most anime humor, to me, is more slapstick and intolerable, however, this anime follows in the footsteps of Cowboy Bebop, with great characters, and most certainly a more Western take on things.  The dub was amazing.  In my opinion, the voice actor (eng and jap) for Vash fit PERFECTLY. t10                              Small disclaimer, I love Trigun so much it was one of the first animes I ever watched and is still today one of my favourite anime to watch, I watch it at least every six months that is how much I love this series. Trigun is the story about a mysterious gunslinger by the name Vash the Stampede, he is also known as the Humanoid Typhoon, who carries a 60 billion ‘double dollar’ bounty on his head and his story upon the planet of Gunsmoke. Story: The story starts off very light hearted and comedic, with a lot of the first couple of episodes being                  full of slapstick humour, but showing every so often that at the core this series has the heart of a very serious toned anime. The second half of the series deals a lot more in the heavy stuff cause the stakes get raised around the middle as revelations about our main character are known. The story does a great job of keeping the light tone and the heavy in a perfect balance as the series does well to move itself in a way that it starts out a light-hearted anime and slowly transitions more into the heavy stuff later in the series, so seamlessly that you don’t feel like you’ve walked into a completely different anime. The main overall arc of the entire series is the way it the anime feels about violence, it doesn’t just go killing is evil as is the main character’s way of thinking, we are given both sides to this argument about whether killing is a good or bad thing in any regard and gives the viewer something to think about. Characters:Vash the Stampede is one of the best main characters I have ever seen, he is a classic tortured soul character he carries a big weight from his past but his past also keeps him smiling and handling everything from a friendly non-threatening approach. Vash starts off as our comic relief for the first half of the series; he is the constant focus of much of the slap-stick humour in the series. As the series progresses he goes from being comic relief to the mentioned tortured soul who is desperately trying to fight against a world in which killing is done hourly and just wants to bring Love and Peace.The supporting cast are also great in their own right, Nicholas D Wolfwood is a good opposite character to Vash, he starts out as the same guy very light hearted but with something hidden underneath but he believes killing in the name of good is fine which make him constantly clash with Vash and his ideal of killing is never good. The interactions between the two characters make them even more believable, they feel like they are real people constantly fighting over an argument they both have opposing sides of which in turn makes them respect each other more. Milly Thompson and Meryl Strife make up our other supporting cast they are both insurance girls who are tasked to watching Vash to stop him from causing anymore destruction (which failed most of the time). Both of these characters aren’t as fleshed out as they could be but they do have their purposes are still good characters regardless being sort of neutral players to the events that are happening around them. I don’t like to give spoilers out but the main villain Knives could be more fleshed out but spends most of his time off screen because of reason I won’t explain. However in the second half we are introduced to Legato the leader of a band of killers called the Gun-Ho Guns who work for Knives. Legato is a great villain, he is a man who spends most of his time tormenting Vash desperate for him to kill someone which leads to great conclusion between the two which is too good to spoil. Art: Trigun is a very standard when it comes to art style it has a very 90s heavy budget feel, it isn’t terrible by any stretch but it isn’t doing anything super spectacular in that regard either.  I don’t really how to talk about art styles greatly so this was a bit rushed sorry. Sound:To be short and simple, great soundtrack to this series, all of the tracks have either a upbeat jazz or a very country and western feel to them and in some cases a combination of both. These tracks are well done and add a very powerful atmosphere to the entire series, do yourself a favour and listen to either ‘Blue Funk’ or ‘Never Could Have Been Worse’ these are in my opinion the best tracks on the soundtracks. The opening is really fast paced guitar track which fits to the overly action part of the series, the ending I am in a mix bag with not my favourite track but by no means a bad track. Conclusion/TL;DR:Trigun is an amazing anime with a fantastic story that is both entertaining, full of action but it also makes you think. The characters are very good with our main being one of the best characters in anime. The art style is nothing knew and feels very heavily budgeted but overall is still a good watch and the soundtrack gives the series a very powerful atmosphere that puts it all together. As a fan boy this is a 10/10 series for me, but to the average person I would give this an 9/10, this anime is a must watch for any fan of anime.                              this show was good when it was being funny, not so much when it was being serious. some of the SF elements were great, and vash was cool in general, but his ethics were pretty dumb and they made the end of the series difficult to watch. the characters were enjoyable enough though to make up for the week points of the show, even with some of the pacing issues i suppose i won\\'t get into here   9                              Remember Johnny Bravo? That\\'s an American cartoon that was pretty old too, but still had its charm to entertain viewers even though it wasn\\'t an anime and it was aimed at a younger market. Both Trigun and Johnny Bravo started off a bit silly at first, but I came to like them once the series progressed (which happens to about all TV series). Yet, they may look old but are actually pretty good. Regardless of the fact that Johnny Bravo didn\\'t really have such tense moments as Trigun did.Trigun is a delight for teens and even adults; the prankish characters will entertain the teens and                  even the adults would find such adult humor inclined in this anime, funny yet entertaining. Yet, something entertaining for both of them is full of pranks, characters making up stories, depression and even more. It\\'s a very great mixture blended together in one anime. As the story goes on, it gets more and more tense, serious and even depressing.The real attraction of this anime is its protagonist because determinedly, he is one of the most funniest characters I have ever seen in an anime. In turns, he is also the most moral characters I have ever seen in an anime behind Nausicaa from Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. Although, the antagonists: good-hearted Milly and mysterious Meryl were pretty much average compared to the other great characters in the series. Wolfwood, a child-lover is also up there with one of the top best anime characters you\\'ll ever see in an anime.The characters are done outstandingly that you will fall in love with many of them in the series. The drawings were also done pretty well for its time, but doesn\\'t live it up to its promise like anime such as Cowboy Bebop does. The English Dub, you know wasn\\'t too bad, but I prefer the sub over the dub.I gave Trigun a seven out of ten.                                      Introduction: On April 1st, 1998, Trigun aired its first episode and ended a couple months later on September 30th, 1998. The series didn’t do very well in Japan but, when it came over to the US, the show skyrocketed do to it being aired the Anime Block of Adult Swim (During the Anime Boom of the early 2000’s). It has since then became a classic in anime and you see it on many top favorites lists. So how does it hold up today? Well let’s find out.Actual Review:The story of Trigun follows Vash the Stampede, a man who after destroying an entire city and causing                  damage to many others gains a $$60,000,000,000 reward on his head. This catches the attention of the Bernardelli Insurance Society, who sends out two of their agents, Meryl Strife and Millie Thompson, to find and supervise him as he travels across the desert planet. Along their travels they meet with other characters and people in trouble but, no matter how dangerous it gets, Vash the humanoid typhoon also gets out of every bad situation without killing a single person. Yet, as the group travels, remnants and memories long forgotten start to catch up to Vash. Now the story of Trigun, while being the best aspect of the show, has many hiccups. For one thing the entire first half is filled with a lot of comedy vignettes and misadventures, and is overall pretty formulaic. The basic premise is group goes to town, something bad happens involving Vash, moral is learned after Vash acts like a badass saving the town/person, rinse and repeat. Not that this setup is bad though, the comedy is nice and fun, characters bounce of each other well, and the morals are usually executed well. It also helps that we have the main character Vash, who always has an air of mystery throughout each episode. He really hooks you in and keeps you invested in the story, despite it being lackadaisical.However, during the second half of the show things start to get very serious and this is where the show really shines. All the episodes grip you with good direction and exciting tension, you really root for these characters and when we learn Vash’s backstory it makes the whole show a great watch. This may be jarring to some however because the tonal shift was really fast and kind of out of nowhere. Sure throughout the first half we get hints about Vash and his past, but really it’s not much. So when one of the villains gets introduced it goes from comedy to, “You’re going to die today, Vash the Stampede”, it feels a little strange. This change really only works because we’ve already been able to get to know the characters before hand; so when the drama happens you’re gripped because of the connection you gained with the characters. For this reason, I give awkward tonal shift a pass because it gives us some of the best episodes in the series.The real issue that annoys me is the setting of the story, which isn’t really built up that well. You see, Trigun takes place in the future on a desert planet that is not our own. The whole planet is based of the Wild West and because of this it’s hard to tell what the hell is going on because the show never tells you that this is the future. Instead for about the first 14 episodes of the show, you go around seeing strange lost technology and people the size of skyscrapers with shooting mechanical arm. This may be more realistic from within the universe, but it’s just confusing to the viewer because it could seem more like a confused vision of a world rather than a cohesive one. That’s not the case however because, like Vash, in the second half we learn so much more to help clear things up. Overall, despite these hiccups, Trigun’s story is solid and passionate.Next we have the soundtrack, which is filled with guitars and even some congo drums in the opening. The music is solid and really has some standout tracks, but most of the time it’s not to noticeable because it never really distracts from the show. The opening is a good example of some of the best tracks; it’s basically one guitar solo which I could air guitar to all day because sounds so awesome! It also has some awesome shots of Vash staring into the distance and aiming the shot, the animation is pretty minimal, but it’s still nice. The ending however is pretty lame, the song is nice but the animation is nonexistent so you can skip it or watch it at your leisure.So now let’s talk about the Engilsh dub starting off with a fun fact: In the lead role of Vash we have Johnny Yong Bosch in his first voice acting anime role, but besides that interesting tidbit the dub is okay. It’s mostly hampered by the supporting characters/background characters, because some of them are laughably hilarious. However, all of the main cast and bigger roles in the vignette episodes are great. Sure they may have a slip up here and there, but if you prefer dubs to sub, it’s certainly not a bad option.Finally, we have the animation which was produced by Studio Madhouse. Now as I understand it the animation style here is supposed to be a mix of anime and Marvel super hero styles, but at the end of the day it can be quite wonky. In the first half of the show the character models get minor inconsistencies and some shortcuts are noticeable. It doesn’t really help that sometimes the art-style doesn’t even work well, in fact there are some ugly character models in that may ruin your enjoyment, there usually not there often, but I did notice some. The second half does make up for this though because the animation is much better in control and fluidity, I get this strange feeling Madhouse saved all there money in the serious episodes. Overall, the animation is okay even if it is a messy at points in the series.Verdict:At the end of the day Trigun is a good anime, it may have some setting, dub, and animation issues but it still is a fun watch and the show truly shines in a lot of places. I would definitely recommend this classic to all anyone who can get over the issues I’ve mentioned. Before I go, I should also mention that Trigun was licensed by Pioneer/Geneon, but it’s now owned by Funimation and is easily available on their site and on Netflix. There’s also the two original manga series written by Yasuhiro Nightow, which is published by Dark Horse Comics in America.     nt10                              StoryThe story line is brilliant-but a bit slow to start off. A good portion of the first half is shameless filler-\\'shameless\\' unless you suffer from what is known as \\'second-hand embarrassment. However, if you rewatch, there will be references to the plot during it, but not too often.Really, it\\'s more of an apology for the sound beating this show will give your heart. The second half of the show turns the show in a 180 degree way. It becomes very serious, and if you are prone to tears, carry a tissue box with you. Still, it is excellent.Note that if you have read Trigun and                  Trigun Maximum, you will likely find it lacking, as it seems that the anime censored out a lot of the content.ArtI must admit, I am not a fan of 90s anime art, but considering its time, it is fairly splendid. However, the faces tend to do the 90s thing (never can stay stationary) so that may be a benefit or a negative for you.SoundThe  voice acting is enjoyable. Even what I have heard of the English dub is pleasant to listen to.CharactersI am a sucker for character development and BAM! Even in this toned down version, there is still a lot of character diversity and development. While there are some stereotypes involved, it\\'s not too accentuated. You even grow to like the villains-one of which gets way too little screen time-especially if you\\'ve read the mangas.EnjoymentOh how my schoolwork suffered watching this show. Priorities went out the window as I continued my 26 episode quest to complete this show. Yes, I have to give this a 10 in this category.OverallThis was an epic show, and you need to add this to your list as soon as possible!                              I really wish they did still aired random anime as a special on toonami or adult swim, like they did with Trigun. After a long night at work it\\'d be nice to sit down with a beer and watch this show, as it\\'s well made and the story is laid back and does what it wants. The story revolves around Vash the Stampede, a man who has a price on his head (if you\\'ve seen the show they say how much it is a million times), and his adventures on a foreign planet that resembles the wild west. The characters on the show have fairly                  distinct personalities that all add a good amount of flair to the show, and while each of the main four (Vash, Wolfwood, Meryl, and Millie) are different in their own ways, I really enjoyed seeing how their personalities balanced each other out, giving the show consistency and equilibrium in a way. Vash is hilarious, kind, unpredictable, and of course, human (sort of) and is easily one of the most well written characters in anime. Trigun has pretty good plot consistency too, as each episode is action packed, really funny, and each one seems to pick up a trail of puny breadcrumbs of Vash\\'s backstory along the way. My problems with the show are pretty few, there ARE some filler episodes, some of the action gets a little repetitive, and the last gripe is a personal one; but it felt like the ending was missing...something. But other than thatl Trigun is a really solid show, it\\'s funny, has good action, an interesting plot once Vash\\'s backstory is explained, the art is clearly older but that\\'s not a bad thing, and this might sound corny but it\\'s got heart. It\\'s cool to see the characters grow. However the ending theme of morality that had to do with Vash not killing Vicious \"because he\\'s the good guy\" was a really stupid ending and I really couldn\\'t take the nauseating ending or Vash seriously anymore. So despite the paramount ending being not so paramount; good show.                                       Ahh Trigun, why did it take me so long to watch you? XD I mean every anime fan I have meant have told me to check out this anime..But it took me years to finally watch it last week. I feel like beating my head off a door! This series was so good!! No wonder people called it a gateway drug!! (Gateway drug means a anime that can get someone into anime :D).    So did I like Trigun? Oh yes. VERY YES :D At first I through I wouldn\\'t get into because of the odd animating; but I got used to                  the animation and watched a great story unfold!! Trigun has a great story but what really got was the characters. I love Series that have great character development and Trigun had it. Speciality with Vash, Wolfwood, and the two girls. And one other thing Vash is so..WOW. A kind of guy that just can\\'t help but be repressed by. He will never kill but..Is that a good thing, a good thing this series does is the depth of Vash\\'s torment as he finds himself questioning everything.    Can I add that Wolfwood is hot without getting called shallow? No? Then forget what I said just then XD If there is one reason for you guys to check this out it\\'s the characters you will fall in love with them. Trigun is just a series that comes every decade that is just plain cool!~! CHECK IT OUT! DON\\'T BE LIKE I WAS AND WATCH IT AS SOON AS YOU CAN!! :D                                      Trigun is such a great and fun show to watch. You got the eccentric Vash the Stampede, and great line-up of supporting characters which really accent his character development across the story. Now the comedy throughout the show synthesizes well with both the action & drama - you really get a good kick out of the whole show. Meanwhile you\\'re trying to fathom what Vash\\'s decision on the matter at hand is gonna be. Hell. . . I want a doughnut now. Here\\'s to you Vash!  10                              Trigun reviewYou know you better Read this!! Just do it!note: For the sake of a spoiler-free review I\\'m gonna have to be a little bit less specific on some areas. characterscons- I felt like there should have been more back-story when it came to some of The Final Evil bad guys\\' minions. It was never explain why these guys did what they did. It was kinda like the authors said \"This is the way things are. why? because I said so!\" (Again this isn\\'t really a con when taken into consideration this is only a 25 episode anime and it would probably interrupt the flow                  of the story if there were to many back-flashes)pros- The cast of three to four main characters is fairly small.- The Main cast is well defined and developed throughout the course of the anime.- Interesting, unique, and lovable character design. I mean who doesn\\'t love the doughnut fanatic, silly, playboy Vash the Stampede.- The supporting main characters did a great job of helping to developing Vash in various parts of the anime. Storycons- Ok, its plot kinda lame...I know I was expecting something..... more? But then again this is an 90\\'s style anime and while its not gonna have you hands over heels; its -> (continued in pros)pros- Very well written and simple explains everything it need to without any problems.- Again, I like the way the story is developed. It starts with Fillerish episodes to introduce and starts to develop the characters; then it slowly and seamlessly morphs into an more serous anime along the way. - Although its implies several time gaps between episodes. It never really seem like the timeline is rushed or episodic.comedycons- HAHahahhaahahaha.... Wait?! You really thought I\\'d be able to come up with a con on this one; Like I actually have a sense of humor.......pros- Absolutely Hilarious. Of course it does dies down in the second half of the anime when things start to develop and get more serous. sound/musiccons-Sound effect may seem cheesy at times-(I personally didn\\'t like the) OP/EDpros- The English dub is one that is well written and the cast is well suited for the characters. Especially considering when it was made.- the \"cheesy\" BGM(background music) and sound effects; for the most part added to the \"Western era\" feel. animation/Artcons-It was made in the 1990\\'s, its style of animation is outdated pros- On the flip side, I feel the animation adds to the whole western feel of it and it\\'s a trait that I feel refines its individuality.Overall/closing thoughtsThis is one of those animes that got me into anime in the first place. Trigun is and always will be on my list of favorite animes of all time. It\\'s one of those shows I knew I was gonna love from the first episode and that I knew that I\\'d be sad once I finished it. I got to say that after watching anime I\\'ll never ever be able to say that six shooter isn\\'t the coolest weapon on earth or any where else for that matter.closing ratingsplot/story: 9characters: 10animation: 8sound: 8X-factor: 10overall Reviewers standpoint: 9Personal standpoint:10                              I first heard of this from my friend from school. It is his favorite anime and he recommended it to me. I finally got to watching it and was happy with the result. I enjoyed how the story eased in from being kinda silly wit hsmall incidents, to more serious with complicated situations. The characters were also very enjoyable, especially Wolfwood, which is one of my personal favorites. (i do like Vash, although he did cry a bit too much near the end) The fights were good, although a bit more sparse than i had hoped, but not a problem. The atmophere was also very                  intriging, what with the space wastland, space coyboy feel. The biggest issue i had with this anime was the philosophy it kept hammering into my head during the second half: itr is never right to kill. Now i dont know what anyone elses opinion on that is, thats ur own, but regardless it seemed to kinda crippled the anime a bit (as well as turn vash emo). Ive seen this philosophy in other anime too such as Rurouni Kenshin and Genadier but not as heavy as this one. Also i can kinda understand Kenshin wat with his past but vash was just crying over some words his past friend said (yes it is sad i emphasize, but it isnt an excuse to go bawl ur eyes out every time u cant save everyone, especially ur enemies) Anyway, broken philosophy aside (at least by my beliefs), Trigun was an excellent story with interesting characters and a great atmosphere.         nt8                              Could be argued as one of the contenders for best anime ever, it was one of the first I started with.The art style feels older but it works for the western motif the show has going for it. I also wasn\\'t amazed by the soundtrack. The music fit the setting, but I never really wanted to hear anything again... which was too bad because that show loves repeating itself music-wise.However, the story starts off somewhat simple and slowly builds on itself. The characters are likable and the villains are fascinating (particularly Legato).This review is probably pointless though... pretty much everyone has seen this thing or                  plans on seeing it... and good for them.        t9                              One of the all time classics \\'\\'Trigun\\'\\'. It\\'s a very hard anime to review because when i first start to watch trigun after first 10 episodes i stopped because of the animation but after my friend plead me to watch it again and tell that it gets better near the end and i thank him.STORYThe plot seems very simple for half of the sires it seemed like a episodic western show but after the appearance of the gun ho guns aka the main villains and the beckstory of Vash the story gets a lot better. The funny thing was that when i watched it first                  time i thought it was a western type a show with maybe some supernatural but it is a sci-fi western like cowboy bebop but it did well to hide the sci-fi elements that you wont notice on till the half of the show. The best part of the story is the moment at the end are all one of the most intense and epic moments in anime history like the moment when Lagato and Vash were facing off it is my single favorite face of in anime that i have watched.CHARACTERSThe best part about the show is the characters and how they develop the characters even the episodic characters are well developed. Some characters that were annoying at the start (insurance girls) i started liking them til the end. The main character Vash is the heart of this anime his one of the best and funny protagonist in anime right there with spike spigel but what makes him such a great character is his tragic past and finding out what his been through it\\'s very sad. All the villains in this show are awesome and the main villain Knives is my most hated villain of all time i cant stand him.ArtThe animation and art is very inconsistent sometimes very good but some times it looks like a show was made in the early 80s not late 90s.SOUNDI love the music in this show it fit the show and it had the most kick ass anime opening ever. Its a rare anime where i have listened to the whole soundtrack and have bought the soundtrack.OVERALLI enjoyed this anime classic and it deserves all the praise it gets even if it has an animation that sometimes its hard to look at but what they say you never judge a book by its cover. I give this anime a 9/10        10                              This is was one of the first anime i was introduced to. Growing up in the United States and limited me to a lot of anime. But not this gem.My attempt at writing a review for this wonderful piece of art is intended to give you a good idea of what a good story and art can do when they work together.Vash the stampede caught my eye as a child i always felt i could relate to being the loner in social groups and feeling like i knew things or lived beyond my lifespan sometimes. Often feeling i couldn\\'t connect with things around me even                  in the music my family or friends listened to and enjoyed. I was always different.Trigun naturally appealed to me and showed me that with the right story and art direction a connection can be made to something in this world. It sounds nuts i know but let\\'s consider some things that this anime truly a interesting watch.1. Gun play is tasteful and often meant to be the last resort.2. The main character always feels he can\\'t become attached to those he meets.3. Despite the latter he still has a kind heart and helps many.4. The search for the big bad or closure is innate in all of us.Those points put out there i think it\\'s great to see a main character who is plagued by personal thoughts and demons. But yet, he is still able to put those aside to care for someone else\\'s needs.What feels like the old west and often depressing truly sets the tone for this lone gunman. The spirit of the western frontier is no doubt alive in the people who were instrumental in making this show come to life. While at times the sound mixing for what i watched on tv and found on the dvd\\'s was troublesome to mess with it didn\\'t detract from the great imagery and didn\\'t slow the story down or hinder it from being told.Japanese or English both versions sound great although it\\'s my personal preference to watch with the English dub. For the straight fact that the diversity of wording and accents is a must to make each character no matter how small the role all the more immersive into the world that is Trigun.Hope this isn\\'t to wordy it is my first shared opinion in form of review i\\'ve ever written. So have fun and i\\'m sure there is something in this anime for everyone :)        nt10                              If you like action, this anime could go either way. It can either be really awesome, or just good. Personally this is one of my favorite anime. The Humanoid Typhoon, that there is just badass...The characters are really well developed, they are diverse. You got your alien man who\\'s an ace gunman but is devoted to not killing, and is devoted to donuts, drinking and dames. Ex-priest who carries his burdens (i.e. giant cross) and yes he is badass. Two women who are not annoying but allow for some funny moments and give insight to this mystery man. And finally the alien man who wants                  to kill because he can. The story i just love.nothing more to say.Recently a movie has come out about Trigun, and the art there is beautiful, this was made in 1998 so the visuals might be eyesore for some. But i think it adds to the whole western style. Music is pretty good too. If you like guns, action, laughs, good characters, good story, then you\\'ll like Trigun.          9                              Trigun is the very first anime I watched from start to finish. That was a long time ago. So I watched it again when I started getting into anime. Trigun is just... good. It just is. There isn\\'t a better way to say it. It is hilarious, entertaining, and the plot just never slows down.I particularly like the wild west/wasteland feel, but that is not the main reason I like it. The main reason is the morality. The hero chooses to do things the right way rather than easy way, which is something that you just don\\'t see that much anymore. It\\'s admirable.Trigun is not                  perfect. While going over the top can be a good thing, Trigun sometimes gets too ridiculous. However, this flaw is not enough to keep me from recommending this anime to anyone.        ment10                              This anime is a true classic, a masterpiece! Who could not resist watching this anime over and over again without laughing? It\\'s story plot is pure genious, as you follow a legendary gunman, Vash, with a huge bounty on his head. He\\'s wanted for blowing up the  city of July, but in reality, Vash would never harm a fly. He hides his identity around people, and purposefully acts like a goof ball to fool everyone that he is not the real Vash. He then befriends Meryl and Millie, who are assigned to keep watch of him and prevent him from causing anymore damage. Throughout                  the series, you start to see why Vash is considered a \\'dangerous man\\' and see how he really feels on the inside. After befriending Nicholas D. Wolfwood, the two become inseperable friends. Although they had some arguments, they never questioned their friendship. Vash evetually changed Wolfwoods views on killing, and Wolfwood eventually dies after sparing his master Chapel. Legato has 10 Gun-ho-Guns chasing after Vash to make his life miserable, requested by his twin brother Knives. You\\'ll see that these two brothers relationship is strained, because Vash loved his human caretaker Rem, and Knives killed her and the Seeds ship members. Vash still has hope in humanity, but Knives gave up on it 100 years ago. Knives was the reason Vash was a wanted man, because Knives caused July to be blown up. In the end, Vash wins the battle against his brother with his gunmanship skills, and by using Wolfwoods \\'Divine Mercy\\' weapon. He doesn\\'t kill Knives, and spares him after still living by Rem\\'s way of life.        '"
